# Curation Interface(CI)

This documents describes different things you can do with the curation interface. 

## Folder/File Structure

* Javascript code is in src/js_src folder
* Check routes.js to see how routes and pages are structured


## Add Page to CI

* Add a container component for the page you would like to add to CI
* Add curate-home layout to the new component
* Add the component to router.js
* Add new component to layout.js
* Run the app, newly added page should be there now

## Test Page

* add basic test case for your newly created container component just to make sure it's able to render before you start adding more layers to your code.
