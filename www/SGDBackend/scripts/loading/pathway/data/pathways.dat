COMMENT - Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts |CITS: [Lynen69]|. To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) |CITS: [1350093]|).  Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) |CITS: [7649444]|).
/
/There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6  |CITS: [17448991]|. Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) |CITS: [365179], [1100391], [10785388], [3528750], [374077]|.
/
/FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 |CITS: [7925441]| and theinositol/choline-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p |CITS: [1461729][7862526]|. The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 |CITS: [11713312]|. The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded |CITS: [1735446][8262967]|.

COMMENT - The glyoxylate cycle, also called the glyoxylate shunt, is present in fungi, plants, and bacteria, but not in
/ mammals. The cycle is essential for growth on two-carbon compounds such as ethanol and acetate, and
/ plays an anaplerotic role in the provision of precursors for biosynthesis.  The glyoxylate cycle is
/ comprised of many of the same reactions as the TCA cycle, but it does not include the two
/ decarboxylation reactions.  As a result, two-carbon substrates, which enter the cycle as acetyl-CoA, 
/can be converted to four-carbon compounds, which in turn can be further metabolized to create sugars and other essential
/ organic compounds. 
/
/Although several of the reactions of the glyoxylate and TCA cycle are identical, many of them are
/ catalyzed by different isozymes in different cellular compartments. The glyoxylate cycle occurs in the
/ peroxisome and cytoplasm, while the TCA cycle occurs in the mitochondria. Utilization of two-carbon
/ compounds by yeast also requires the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, which are coordinately regulated
/ with the glyoxylate cycle.  The succinate provided by the glyoxylate cycle enters the TCA cycle where it
/ is converted to malate; malate then reenters the cytoplasm where it is converted to oxaloacetate and
/ eventually to glucose via gluconeogenesis.
/
/The key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, as well as malate
/dehydrogenase, are regulated in yeast in response to the carbon source of the growth medium. Synthesis of these enzymes is repressed in cells grown on glucose and derepressed in media lacking
/glucose (as reported in |CITS:[5345986]|.
/
/Although S. cerevisiae is rarely found in human hosts, phagocytosis of S. cerevisiae by mammalian
/macrophages results in the induction of genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes; this is thought to be
/a response to the nutrient-poor environment of the phagolysosome |CITS:[12455685][11452311]|.

COMMENT - Unsaturated fatty acids are essential for all eukaryotes; they are key components of cellular membranes and are used for energy storage.  While most eukaryotes can synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can only form monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily |FRAME: CPD-9245| (16:l) and |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| (18:1) (|FRAME: PWY3O-1801| and |FRAME: PWY3O-5268|).
/
/The monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleate (16:l) and oleate (18:1) are formed by the introduction of a single carboUnsaturated fatty acids are essential for all eukaryotes; they are key components of cellular membranes and are used for energy storage.  While most eukaryotes can synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can only form monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily palmitoleate (16:l) and oleate (18:1). n - carbon double bond into the saturated fatty acyl-CoA, palmitoyl and stearoyl-CoA, respectively. OLE1 encodes the sole S. cerevisiae delta-9 fatty acid desaturase, an ER membrane-bound protein that is required for the production of monounsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [1978720]|. Ole1p catalyzes the formation of a double bond between carbons 9 and 10 (denoted by delta-9) in the cis configuration.  Other fungi and eukaryotes have additional fatty acid desaturases that can produce double bonds in the delta12 and delta15 position.  
/
/The Ole1p sequence is similar to homologs in rat and human (SCD1) over the majority of the protein, including a cluster of histidine residues that coordinate the binding of a diiron-oxo prosthetic group within the catalytic site (reviewed in |CITS: [16920014]|). The rat and yeast proteins are similar enough that exogenously expressed rat protein can rescue an ole1 null mutant |CITS: [1978720]|. However, Ole1p has an additional C-terminal, 113 amino acid extension (relative to the rat protein), which encodes a cytochrome b5-like domain not found in mammalian desaturases. In animal cells, cytochrome b5 is thought to be the electron donor for fatty acid desaturation. In contrast, the yeast cytochrome b5 (Cyb5) is dispensable for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids because Ole1p contains inherent electron donor activity. The rat protein is unable to rescue an ole1 cyb5 double mutant |CITS:[8530368]|.
/
/OLE1 is highly regulated at the levels of both transcription and mRNA stability (reviewed in |CITS: [16920014 ]| and |CITS: [17087771]|). OLE1 transcription is decreased in response to high fatty acid levels |CITS: [2687232][1556107]| and increased in response to low oxygen |CITS: [10318903]| and low temperature |CITS: [11855848]|. Much of the transcriptional regulation is mediated by two homologous ER membrane-bound transcription factors, Spt23p and Mga2p. In response to stimuli, both Spt23p and Mga2p are activated by ubiquitin-dependent processing into their soluble forms, and then targeted to the nucleus |CITS: [9927444][11007476] [11557770]|. Independent of the transcriptional regulation, OLE1 mRNA is also stabilized under fatty acid free conditions and destabilized when fatty acids are added to the growth medium |CITS: [8824209]|. Mga2p, but not Spt23p, contributes to the regulation of OLE1 mRNA stability |CITS: [15220333]|.

COMMENT - The electron transport chain is the final step of the respiratory pathway, 
/carried out by several large multisubunit enzyme complexes embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane. 
/The net effect of the electron transport chain is to transfer electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen, coupled 
/to transport of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane.  The proton transport creates an electrochemical  
/gradient across the membrane, which is then used to power ATP synthesis by the mitochondrial inner membrane 
/F1F0 ATP synthase as well as transport of metabolites across the membrane |CITS: [11245784]|.
/
/NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NADH dehdrogenase) catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone, 
/generating ubiquinol and NAD+ |CITS: [11245784][1900238]|.  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabata 
/and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a single-subunit enzyme provides this activity (Ndi1p in S. cerevisiae).  In many other fungi, mammals,
/ insects, and plants, this activity resides in a multisubunit complex, Complex I, which transports a proton across 
/the mitochondrial inner membrane concomitantly with NADH oxidation |CITS: [11245784]|.
/
/The succinate dehydrogenase complex (Complex II) catalyzes the oxidation of succinate by ubiquinone to fumarate, 
/generating ubiquinol and fumarate.  This reaction does not result in transfer of a proton across the mitochondrial 
/inner membrane. In S. cerevisiae the complex is composed of the flavoprotein subunit Sdh1p, the iron-sulfur protein 
/subunit Sdh2p, the cytochrome b subunit Sdh3p, and the membrane anchor subunit Sdh4p |CITS: [14672929]|.
/
/The ubiquinol generated by NADH dehydrogenase and Complex II is oxidized to ubiquinone by 
/ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (Complex III; cytochrome bc1 complex) in a stepwise electron transfer through 
/the complex that results in the reduction of cytochrome c and the transfer of a proton across the mitochondrial 
/membrane |CITS: [12788490]|.  The cytochrome c that is reduced in this step is the product of the CYC1 gene.

/inner membrane |CITS: [1665335][7851399]|.

CITATIONS - BIOCHEMISTRYSULFURCYCLE
COMMENT - Sulfur is found in many important biological compounds, including the amino acids methionine and cysteine, the coenzymes biotin and coenzyme A, and other metabolites such as glutathione. Although most of these compounds contain reduced sulfur, in nature the major form of inorganic sulfur available to many microorganisms is sulfate. In order to use sulfate to synthesize organic sulfur compounds, particularly sulfur amino acids and their derivatives, plants and many microorganisms import and reduce sulfate via the sulfate assimilation pathway.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the sulfate assimilation pathway consists of sulfates uptake via Sul1p and Sul2p, activation to adenylate compounds, reduction to sulfide, and subsequent incorporation into carbon chains. The importance of activating sulfate to adenylyl sulfate (APS) and phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) stems from the fact that physiological reducing agents (e.g. NADPH, NADH) are not large enough in E<sub>0</sub>' to reduce sulfate directly. Adenylation lowers sulfate's electropotential, enabling cells to circumvent what would otherwise be an endergonic reaction. After its conversion to PAPS, sulfate is reduced to sulfite by PAPS reductase (Met16p) and again to sulfide by sulfite reductase (Met5p and Met10p). The subsequent incorporation of sulfide into a carbon chain varies by organism; in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, sulfide can react with O-acetylhomoserine via Met17p to form homocysteine, the major intermediate in the biosynthesis and interconversion of methionine and cysteine. In plants and enteric bacteria, sulfide can react with O-acetylserine to form cysteine directly.
/
/The induction of all genes involved in the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> sulfate assimilation pathway depends upon the leucine-zipper transcriptional activator Met4p. Met4p induces MET gene expression in cysteine-limiting conditions, while under cysteine-rich conditions Met4p transcriptional activity is negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Met30). Furthermore, sulfur transport is inhibited in this organism by intracellular sulfate and sulfur metabolites such as APS and cysteine.

COMMENT - Unsaturated fatty acids are essential for all eukaryotes; they are key components of cellular membranes and are used for energy storage.  While most eukaryotes can synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can only form monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily |FRAME: CPD-9245| (16:l) and |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| (18:1) (|FRAME: PWY3O-1801| and |FRAME: PWY3O-5268|). 
/
/The monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleate (16:l) and oleate (18:1) are formed by the introduction of a single carbon - carbon double bond into the saturated fatty acyl-CoA, palmitoyl and stearoyl-CoA, respectively. OLE1 encodes the sole S. cerevisiae delta-9 fatty acid desaturase, an ER membrane-bound protein that is required for the production of monounsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [1978720]|. Ole1p catalyzes the formation of a double bond between carbons 9 and 10 (denoted by delta-9) in the cis configuration.  Other fungi and eukaryotes have additional fatty acid desaturases that can produce double bonds in the delta12 and delta15 position.  
/
/The Ole1p sequence is similar to homologs in rat and human (SCD1) over the majority of the protein, including a cluster of histidine residues that coordinate the binding of a diiron-oxo prosthetic group within the catalytic site (reviewed in |CITS: [16920014]|). The rat and yeast proteins are similar enough that exogenously expressed rat protein can rescue an ole1 null mutant |CITS: [1978720]|. However, Ole1p has an additional C-terminal, 113 amino acid extension (relative to the rat protein), which encodes a cytochrome b5-like domain not found in mammalian desaturases. In animal cells, cytochrome b5 is thought to be the electron donor for fatty acid desaturation. In contrast, the yeast cytochrome b5 (Cyb5) is dispensable for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids because Ole1p contains inherent electron donor activity. The rat protein is unable to rescue an ole1 cyb5 double mutant |CITS:[8530368]|.
/
/OLE1 is highly regulated at the levels of both transcription and mRNA stability (reviewed in |CITS: [16920014 ]| and |CITS: [17087771]|). OLE1 transcription is decreased in response to high fatty acid levels |CITS: [2687232][1556107]| and increased in response to low oxygen |CITS: [10318903]| and low temperature |CITS: [11855848]|. Much of the transcriptional regulation is mediated by two homologous ER membrane-bound transcription factors, Spt23p and Mga2p. In response to stimuli, both Spt23p and Mga2p are activated by ubiquitin-dependent processing into their soluble forms, and then targeted to the nucleus |CITS: [9927444][11007476] [11557770]|. Independent of the transcriptional regulation, OLE1 mRNA is also stabilized under fatty acid free conditions and destabilized when fatty acids are added to the growth medium |CITS: [8824209]|. Mga2p, but not Spt23p, contributes to the regulation of OLE1 mRNA stability |CITS: [15220333]|.

COMMENT - Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts |CITS: [Lynen69]|. To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) |CITS: [1350093]|).  Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) |CITS: [7649444]|). 
/
/There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6  |CITS: [17448991]|. Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) |CITS: [365179], [1100391], [10785388], [3528750], [374077]|.
/
/FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 |CITS: [7925441]| and theinositol/choline-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p |CITS: [1461729][7862526]|. The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 |CITS: [11713312]|. The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded |CITS: [1735446][8262967]|.

CITATIONS - 3888627
COMMENT - The non-protein amino acid gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) plays an important role in mammalian neurotransmission,
/plant development, and in S.cerevisiae, nitrogen utilization and oxidative stress tolerance |CITS: [11031268]|, |CITS:[3888627]|.
/In yeast, GABA accumulation occurs either through permease-mediated uptake by Uga4p, Put4p, and Gap1p, or it is 
/produced intracellularly via glutamate degradation by the glutamate decarboxylase Gad1p |CITS: [11031268]|, |CITS: [3888627]|.
/The presence of GABA causes an increase in expression of the genes UGA1 and UGA2, which encode the enzymes 
/responsible for degrading GABA into succinate |CITS:[3888627]|. This GABA-induced upregulation is mediated
/by the transcriptional activators Uga3p and Uga35p/Dal81p |CITS:[2653828]|. These transcription factors bind to upstream activation sites in the promoters of  GABA-regulated genes known as the UAS-GABA |CITS:[12235130]|, |CITS: [2653828]|. Levels of UGA2 transcript are also upregulated under conditions of oxidative stress |CITS:[11031268]|. S.cerevisiae cells in which GABA degradation is blocked are more sensitive to oxidative stress and can no longer grow on GABA as their sole nitrogen source |CITS:[11031268]|, |CITS:[3888627]|.

COMMENT - Methylglyoxal is toxic compound that is formed as a by-product of glycolysis from triose phosphates through the action of triose-phosphate
/isomerase. One route by which methylglyoxal can be catabolized is a glyoxalase system in which methylglyoxal is condensed with glutathione to
/give S-D-lactoylglutathione by the action of glyoxalase I (GLO1) |CITS: [8824231]|, and the glutathione thiolester is then hydrolyzed to lactic acid and glutathione
/by glyoxalase II (GLO2 and GLO4) |CITS: [9261170]|. The GLO2 gene is expressed on both glucose and glycerol and the active Glo2p protein is localized in the
/cytoplasm. The GLO4 gene is only active on glycerol and the active Glo4p is localized in the mitochondrial matrix |CITS: [9261170]|. Deletion of either GLO1 or GLO2

COMMENT - Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a central intermediate in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, de novo synthesis of PA occurs primarily through two acylation pathways: the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway and the dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) pathway. In both routes of PA synthesis, G3P and DHAP are converted to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and subsequently acylated to PA by 1-acyl-sn-G3P acyltransferases (Slc1p, Ale1p, and Loa1p). G3P/DHAP acyltransferases (Sct1p and Gpt2p) catalyze the first step in both pathways, acylating G3P to LPA or DHAP to 1-acyl-DHAP. Further conversion of 1-acyl-DHAP to LPA occurs via a NADPH-dependent reaction catalyzed by 1-acyl-DHAP reductase (Ayr1p). After its formation from LPA, PA can be cleaved to diacylglycerol by phosphatidate phosphatases (Pah1p, Dpp1p, Lpp1p, and App1p) for the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols. Alternatively, PA can be converted by CDP-DAG synthases (Cds1p and Tam41p) to cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), the precursor to all major phospholipids in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.
/
/The universal route of PA biosynthesis is the G3P pathway, which exists in prokaryotes, plants, yeast, and mammalian cells. In contrast, the DHAP pathway is present only in yeast and mammals. Aside from these de novo pathways, PA synthesis may also occur through alternative routes such as phosphorylation of diacylglycerol by DAG kinase (Dgk1p in yeast) and hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D (Spo14p in yeast).

COMMENT - Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a major structural component of cellular membranes and one of the most abundant phospholipids in eukaryotes. The roles of PE in the cell are many: it contributes to membrane architecture, influences the structure and activity of integral and peripheral membrane proteins, is required for mitochondrial function in yeast, and plays important roles in cell division and autophagy. In addition, PE donates the phosphoethanolamine required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol, a lipid anchor involved in attaching proteins to the cell surface.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the major route of PE synthesis involves the production and decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. Alternatively, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> can synthesize PE from free ethanolamine via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway. This route consists of three steps: 1) phosphorylation of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine by ethanolamine kinase (Eki1p) or choline kinase (Cki1p), 2) activation of phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine by phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Ect1p), and 3) transfer of a phosphoethanolamine moiety from CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol by 1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase (Ept1p). The other branch of the Kennedy pathway, the CDP-choline pathway, analogously incorporates choline into phosphatidylcholine (PC).
/
/The Kennedy pathway is not essential in yeast. Nevertheless, it plays an important role in PE and PC synthesis when the preferred de novo pathways are disrupted or repressed. This stands in contrast to mammalian cells, where the Kennedy pathway represents the major route of synthesis and is essential for mammalian development.

COMMENT - Many yeast and bacterial species ferment pyruvate to 2,3-butanediol via the intermediate, acetoin.  Although acetoin is a flavorless compound, it is a precursor to some off-odor compounds, such as diacetyl, which can be unfavorable in beer and wine.  Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are both by-products of alcoholic fermentation by S. cerevisiae and other wine yeasts. Acetoin production during alcoholic fermentation depends on the yeast strain and other variables such as substrate and temperature (as reported in |CITS: [16535224]|). Wine yeasts with high fermentation power generally produce low acetoin levels and large amounts of ethanol and higher alcohols (alcohols with more than 2 carbons) (as reported in |CITS: [16535224]|).

COMMENT - In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, mitochondrial acetyl-CoA reserves are biochemically isolated and cannot be transported to the cytosol to support processes such as protein acetylation and fatty acid biosynthesis. Instead, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> obtains cytosolic acetyl-CoA through the activation of acetate. Acetate activation to acetyl-CoA occurs via the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of acetate and coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA. Two genes encode for acetyl-CoA synthetase in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: ACS1 and ACS2. ACS1 is a glucose-repressed gene required for growth on acetate during glucose starvation, while ACS2 is a constitutively expressed gene essential for cell viability in glucose medium. ACS1 is repressed by Ume6p and is activated by Adr1p and Cat8p in the absence of glucose. Double mutants of acs1 and acs2 are inviable, suggesting that acetate activation by acetyl-CoA synthetase is an essential source of acetyl-CoA in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Likewise, acs2 mutants are inviable when grown on glucose medium due to repression of ACS1.

COMMENT - In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, citrulline is a metabolic intermediate in the latter, cytosolic half of the arginine biosynthesis pathway. Citrulline production requires two intermediates: ornithine, the product of the first five steps of arginine biosynthesis in the mitochondrion, and carbamoyl phosphate, which is synthesized in the cytosol from ATP, CO2, and the amide group of glutamine via carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (Cpa1p/Cpa2p). After ornithine is transported from the mitochondrion to the cytosol by Ort1p, ornithine carbamoyltransferase (Arg3p) catalyzes the transfer of the carbamoyl group from carbamoyl phosphate to the -amino group of ornithine to form citrulline.

COMMENT - In some organisms, the metabolism of extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) plays an important role in purine salvage and uptake. In humans, for instance, extracellular NAD+ generated via cell lysis or other means can be salvaged for adenine through the following steps: 1) cleavage of NAD+ to AMP and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by NAD+ pyrophosphatase, 2) cleavage of AMP to release adenosine via 5-nucleotidase, 3) transport of extracellular adenosine into the cell via adenosine transporters, and 4) regeneration of adenine nucleotides from adenosine via phosphorylation. This process has been implicated human immune cell activation. 
/<p>
/Extracellular metabolism of NMN, but not NAD+, is known to occur in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. This occurs via Pho5p, the major secreted acid phosphatase in yeast. Pho5p catalyzes the conversion of exogenous NMN in the periplasm to nicotinamide riboside (NR), a NAD+ precursor that can be imported into the cell and converted back to NAD+ via salvage pathways. Deletion of PHO5 prevents growth of a mutant disrupted in the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway on medium containing NMN. In addition to Pho5p, two other enzymes are known to play a role in catabolizing extracellular nucleotides in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: the nucleotide pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases Npp1p and Npp2p. Both yeast enzymes belong to a superfamily of alkaline phosphatases that also includes extracellular 5-nucleotidases from mammals.

COMMENT - In eukaryotes, metabolism is compartmented and does not occur homogenously throughout the cell. As a consequence, membrane-impermeable metabolites produced in one cellular compartment often cannot support biochemical pathways in another compartment unless they are transferred to the site of action. Several mechanisms exist in eukaryotes for the translocation of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) between cellular compartments. The carnitine shuttle, which uses carnitine to carry activated acetyl from coenzyme A across intracellular membranes, is one such example. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, acetyl-CoA can be generated in the peroxisome via fatty acid -oxidation and in the cytoplasm via degradation of non-fermentable carbon sources. The carnitine shuttle plays an important role in transporting the activated acetyl generated from these processes into mitochondria for further metabolism in the TCA cycle.
/
/The carnitine shuttle begins with the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to carnitine via carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT), forming acetyl-carnitine. There are several CATs in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: Cat2p, localized in peroxisomes and mitochondria; Yat1p, localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane; and Yat2p, localized in the cytosol. After its formation, acetyl-carnitine is transported into the mitochondrion via carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (Crc1p). Mitochondrial CAT (Cat2p) then catalyzes the reverse transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-carnitine to coenzyme A, regenerating acetyl-CoA and carnitine inside the mitochondrion.

COMMENT - Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose, is a storage molecule whose
/accumulation is under rigorous control in many cells |CITS:11152943|. Glycogen metabolism increases in response to a wide
/variety of environmental stresses, including heat stress or exposure
/to sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, copper sulfate, high levels of

COMMENT - Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q; CoQ) is a lipophilic, redox-active molecule present in cell membranes. For its ability to sustain continuous oxidation-reduction cycles, ubiquinone functions as both a membrane antioxidant and an electron carrier in many cellular pathways. In the electron transport chain, it transfers electrons from complex I and complex II to complex III. Ubiquinone is composed of a quinone core and a polyisoprenoid tail whose chain length varies according to species. The principal ubiquinone in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> has six subunits (CoQ6), whereas mice and humans have nine (CoQ9) and ten (CoQ10) subunits, respectively.
/
/In yeast, the polyisoprenoid tail of ubiquinone derives from the two main products of the mevalonate pathway: dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate (DPP) and isopentenyl-pyrophosphate (IPP). The condensation of DPP with one or more units of IPP produces short-chain polyprenyl diphosphates, such as farnesyl-PP (FPP) and geranylgeranyl-PP (GGPP), which serve as precursors for many primary metabolites. In the CoQ biosynthetic pathway, these short-chain molecules are further extended by long-chain polyprenyl diphosphate synthases. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Coq1p (hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase) extends the isoprenoid subunit length of FPP or GGPP to six subunits, forming the hexaprenyl precursor to the polyprenyl tail of CoQ6. 
/
/<i>S. cerevisiae</i> derives the quinone component of ubiquinone from either para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) or 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB). While it is known that pABA synthesis from chorismate occurs via Abz1p and Abz2p in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the pathway of 4-HB synthesis is not fully characterized in this organism. It has been proposed that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> possesses a three-step pathway that converts tyrosine to 4-HB. This takes place through the following reactions: 1) deamination of tyrosine to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4-HPP) by Aro8p and Aro9p, 2) conversion of 4-HPP to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (4-Hbz) by an unknown enzyme, and 3) oxidation of 4-Hbz to 4-HB by Hfd1p. 
/
/To synthesize CoQ6 in yeast, 4-HB is condensed with hexaprenyl-diphosphate via Coq2p to form 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. This molecule then undergoes a series of methylation, decarboxylation, and hydroxylation reactions in a pathway involving enzymes encoded by COQ genes. Of all the COQ genes known to be important for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, several members (e.g. COQ4 and COQ9) have yet to be assigned a specific role in the pathway.

COMMENT - Tetrapyrroles, such as heme, siroheme, chlorophyll, and cobalamin (vitamin B12) function as cofactors 
/in a variety of essential biological processes.  Tetrapyrroles are comprised of four pyrrole rings linked 
/together  by single-carbon bridges in a linear or cyclic fashion. The cyclic tetrapyrroles heme and siroheme
/contain an iron-atom coordinated in their central cavity and function in respiration and sulfur assimilation, 
/respectively.  <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> synthesize heme and siroheme <i>de novo</i> via a 
/common pathway up to the intermediate uroporphyrinogen III; oxidative decarboxylation of 
/uroporphyrinogen III leads to the synthesis of heme while its methylation leads to siroheme synthesis.
/
/The first committed precursor in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles is the 5-carbon compound 
/5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) |CITS: [2077690]|.  Animals, fungi, apicomplexan protozoa (such as the 
/malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>) and photosynthetic bacteria, synthesize ALA from 
/succinyl CoA and glycine |CITS: [2789025][15144063]|, while higher plants and other bacteria (including
/ <i>Escherichia coli</I>) synthesize ALA from glutamate |CITS: [2789025][2077690]|. 
/
/In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, HEM1 encodes for ALA synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the first 
/committed step in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles |CITS: [6381051]|. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is an essential 
/factor for Hem1p |CITS: [6381051]|.  The second step, the condensation of ALA to form the pyrrole 
/porphobilinogen,  is catalyzed by ALA dehydratase (also known as porphobilinogen synthase; 
/EC 4.2.1.24), a homo-octameric enzyme encoded by HEM2 |CITS: [2204246]|. Hem3p and Hem4p catalyze
/ the third and fourth steps, respectively.  HEM3 encodes for porphobilinogen 
/deaminase (also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase; EC 2.5.1.61), the enzyme catalyzing the 
/condensation of four molecules of 4-porphobilinogen to form the linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane 
/|CITS: [1508149]|, and HEM4 encodes for uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS; EC 4.2.1.75), the enzyme
/catalyzing the cyclization of hydroxymethylbilane and rearrangement of the fourth pyrrole to form the
/ important intermediate uroporphyrinogen III |CITS: [7597845]|. In the absence of UROS, the linear
/tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane undergoes non-enzymatic cyclization without rearrangement of the fourth
/pyrrole ring to form uroporphyrinogen I, which is not an intermediate in the synthesis of biological 
/tetrapyrroles. Uroporphyrinogen III is a major branch point intermediate leading to biosynthesis of different 
/tetrapyrrole-derived compounds, such as siroheme, heme, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and the 
/methanogenic coenzyme F430 |CITS: [2077690]|.  <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is not believed to synthesize 
/cobalamin de novo |CITS: [9003798][10051442]|.

COMMENT - Chorismate is an intermediate in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan and the vitamins, p-aminobenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate |CITS:[Jones]|. The series of reactions to chorismate, called the shikimate pathway, are common for all of the aforementioned compounds, at which point the pathway branches |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|. One branch proceeds to tryptophan, one to phenylalanine and tyrosine, one to p-aminobenzoate, and one to p-hydroxybenzoate |CITS:[Jones][ 1943992]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The carbon flow through the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal end-products.  The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two isoenzymes, one of which (ARO3) is inhibited by phenylalanine, and the other (ARO4) by tyrosine |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|, and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes.

COMMENT - The first committed step of riboflavin biosynthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is the conversion of GTP to 2,5-diamino-6-(ribosylamino)-4-(3H)-pyrimidinone 5-phosphate (DRAP) via GTP cyclohydrolase II (Rib1p). DRAP is then converted to 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 5-phosphate in two steps: reduction of the ribosyl side chain of DRAP by Rib7p, followed by deamination of the pyrimidine ring via Rib2p. These two steps occur in the reverse order relative to the riboflavin synthesis pathway in bacteria, where deamination of DRAP precedes reduction. The product of the Rib2p reaction is then dephosphorylated and condensed via lumazine synthase (Rib4p) with 4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate, a metabolite of ribulose-5-phosphate. This condensation reaction results in the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)-lumazine. In the final step of the pathway, one molecule of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)-lumazine donates a four-carbon moiety to a second molecule via riboflavin synthase (Rib5p), transforming the xylene ring of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)-lumazine into the isoalloxazine ring of riboflavin. Riboflavin may then go on to be phosphorylated by riboflavin kinase (Fmn1p) to form FMN, and FMN itself can be converted to FAD via FAD synthetase (Fad1p).

COMMENT - The allantoin degradation pathway, which converts allantoin to ammonia and carbon dioxide, allows S. cerevisiae to use allantoin as a sole nitrogen source. Conversion of allantoin to ammonia is carried out by the DAL1, DAL2, and DAL3 gene products, which work sequentially to generate urea |CITS: [3915539]|.  Urea is then degraded to ammonia in a two-step process by the DUR1,2 protein, a multifunctional single enzyme originally thought to be encoded by two tightly-linked genes (hence the name DUR1,2; |CITS: [6105114]|.  The allantoin catabolic pathway genes are regulated by a general signal that responds to the availability of readily utilizable nitrogen sources, and also by pathway-specific induction by allantoin or the intermediate allophanate.  These regulatory effects are mediated by cis-acting DNA elements and the trans-acting factors Gln3p, Gat1p, Dal80p, Dal81p, and Dal82p |CITS: [10488154]||CITS: [12062797]||CITS: [10702289]||CITS: [7899074]|.

COMMENT - Chorismate, an intermediate in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids and the vitamins, p-aminobenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate, is synthesized by the shikimate pathway. The shikimate pathway has been found to be common to all eukaryotes and prokaryotes studied thus far (as reported in |CITS:[1943992]|).  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the initial step is catalyzed by two deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase isoenzymes, one of which (ARO3) is feedback inhibited by phenylalanine, and the other (ARO4) by tyrosine |CITS:[1943992]|.  Both DAHP isoenzymes are derepressed by amino acid starvation (general control of amino acid biosynthesis) |CITS:[2906401]|.  The 5 subsequent reactions are catalyzed by the pentafunctional arom enzyme, Aro1p |CITS:[1943992][2825635]|.  Aro1p is a mosaic of five monofunctional domains, each of which corresponds to one of five separate monofunctional E. coli enzymes |CITS:[1943992][2825635]|.  The last step of chorismate biosynthesis, before the pathway branches to synthesize different terminal products, is catalyzed by Aro2p |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.

COMMON-NAME - arginine degradation (aerobic)
CITATIONS - MAGASANIK
COMMENT - Under conditions where optimal sources of nitrogen are unavailable, S. cerevisiae is able to utilize arginine as its sole nitrogen source.
/Arginine catabolism begins in the cytosol with the hydrolysis of arginine to proline |CITS:[14263163]|, |CITS: [1592829]|.
/Under aerobic condition, the arginine and proline degradation pathways converge; resulting in the conversion of proline 
/to L-glutamate in the mitochondria |CITS: [6997271]|.
/The utilization of arginine as nitrogen source is repressed if better nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, asparagine or glutamine are present.
/This is known as nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) |CITS:[10640599]|. The CAR1, PUT1 and PUT2 genes are subject to the effect of this repression 
/which is mediated by the negative regulator Ure2p |CITS:[8622686]|, |CITS: [7891726]|. In the presence of arginine and the absence of 
/a preferred nitrogen sources, NCR is released by the GATA transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p |CITS: [7568152]|, |CITS: [8816501]|, |CITS:[12796300]|.
/The genes encoding the arginine degradation enzymes are also regulated by factors not involved in NCR. The 
/CAR genes are activated by the globally acting transcription factors Rap1p and Abf1p |CITS: [10559172]|, |CITS: [8816501]| and repressed by the Ume6p-Sin2p-Rpd3p complex |CITS: [10809695]|. The presence of arginine induces CAR1
/and CAR2 expression by the regulators Arg80p, Arg81p, and Mcm1p |CITS:[9065690]|, |CITS:[11119723]|.
/Similarly, the presence of  proline leads to the upregulation of the proline degradation enzymes PUT1 and PUT2 by the transcription factor Put3p |CITS: [10629046]|.
/Also unrelated to NCR, CAR2 expression is induced by allophanate, a degradation product of urea, as well as the 
/two positive regulators Dal181p, Dal82p |CITS:[10559172]|.

COMMENT - The biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> involves a common pathway that metabolizes pyruvate to valine or -ketobutyrate (derived from threonine) to isoleucine. This pathway occurs in the mitochondrion until the final step, where the immediate precursor to valine or isoleucine is converted to its respective amino acid either in the mitochondrion (via Bat1p) or the cytosol (via Bat2p). In a branch of the common pathway, valines immediate precursor can instead be converted to -isopropylmalate via -isopropylmalate synthase (Leu4p and Leu9p), which is subsequently exported to the cytosol and metabolized to leucine in three additional steps.
/
/Many genes in the common pathway of BCAA biosynthesis are induced by Gcn4 in response to starvation for any amino acid. Additionally, the flow of substrates into valine, isoleucine, or leucine biosynthesis is controlled depending on the concentration of each of the three amino acids. Threonine deaminase (Ilv1p), which converts threonine to -ketobutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis, is inhibited by high concentrations of isoleucine. This inhibition is reversed by valine; however, high concentrations of both isoleucine and valine will also result in inhibition. Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS; Ilv2p), which catalyzes the first step in the common pathway of BCAA biosynthesis, is subject to feedback inhibition by valine. Likewise, -isopropylmalate synthase (Leu4p and Leu9p) is also feedback inhibited by its end product, leucine.
/
/Although fungi, eubacteria, archaebacteria, and green plants possess pathways for BCAA biosynthesis, mammals do not. Because of this, identifying inhibitors that target BCAA biosynthesis has been a subject of interest in the development of antimicrobial agents.

COMMENT - Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches.  One branch proceeds to tryptophan and the other to phenylalanine and tyrosine |CITS:[Jones]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The carbon flow through the pathways are regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal end-products.  The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by either isoenzyme Aro3p or Aro4p; Aro3p is inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p by tyrosine |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|, and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan.  Most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes are regulated by the transcriptional activator GCN4.

COMMENT - The glutathione/glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems help maintain the reduced environment of the cell and play a significant role in defending the cell against oxidative stress.  They also have been proposed to play a role in DNA synthesis, protein folding and regulation, and sulfur metabolism |CITS:[11169096],[2668278]|.
/
/Glutaredoxins and thioredoxins are small heat-stable proteins that can reduce disulfides by way of conserved cysteines. Glutaredoxins catalyze reductions of intracellular disulfides or glutathione-mixed disulfides in a coupled system with glutathione, NADPH and glutathione reductase.  Unlike the thioredoxin system where oxidized thioredoxin disulfide is reduced directly by thioredoxin reductase with electrons from NADPH, oxidized glutaredoxin is reduced by glutathione with electrons donated by NADPH |CITS:[2668278]|.
/
/Yeast, similar to bacteria, plants, and humans have monothiol and dithiol glutaredoxins with the conserved active site motif Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys and Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser, respectively |CITS:[11898418]|. Monothiol glutaredoxins (Grx-SH) catalyze the reduction of thiol-glutathione mixed disulfides (Protein-S-S-G) only,
/while dithiol glutaredoxins (Grx-(SH)<sub>2</sub>) reduce both protein disulfides (Protein-S<sub>2</sub>) and GSH-mixed disulfides (Protein-S-S-G) |CITS:[11898418]|.
/
/Five glutaredoxins have been identified in S. cerevisiae, two dithiol glutaredoxins, Grx1p and Grx2p, and three monothiol glutaredoxins, Grx3p, Grx4p, and Grx5p |CITS:[11898418]|. All five glutaredoxins participate in the response against oxidative stress |CITS:[9571241][10567543]|.  GRX1 and GRX2 mutants are sensitive to

COMMENT - The ergosterol biosynthesis pathway is required for generation of a major constituent of the fungal plasma membrane, ergosterol |CITS: [Paltauf]||CITS: [8561481]|. This pathway is fungal-specific; plasma membranes of other organisms are composed predominantly of other types of sterol. However, the pathway is not universally present in fungi; for example, Pneumocystis carinii plasma membranes lack ergosterol |CITS: [12531182]|. In S. cerevisiae, some steps in the pathway are dispensible while others are essential for viability |CITS: [8277826]|.  
/
/The ergosterol biosynthesis pathway has been the subject of intensive investigation as a target of antifungal drugs |CITS: [11815273]|. The major target of azole antifungal drugs is lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, a member of the cytochrome P450 family known as Erg11 protein in many fungal species. Squalene epoxidase (Erg1p in S. cerevisiae) is the specific target of allylamine drugs such as terbinafine |CITS: [14638499]|. Mutations in the genes encoding these enzymes and others in the pathway, as well as alterations in the expression levels of the pathway constituents, can lead to antifungal drug resistance |CITS: [11815273]|.

COMMENT - The tripeptide glutathione (GSH: L-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is a prevalent intracellular thiol that is able to act as a cellular redox buffer due to its low redox potential (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH is involved in many biological processes including: protein and DNA synthesis; amino acid transport; enzyme regulation; protection of cells against reactive oxygen compounds and free radicals, xenobiotics and heavy metals (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH can also be used as a source of sulfur and cysteine in |CITS: [1674526], [10514563]|.
/
/GSH is synthesized from its constituent amino acids by two ATP-dependent steps (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). In the first step &gamma;-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Gsh1p) catalyzes the formation of the dipeptide &gamma;-glutamylcysteine from glutamate and cysteine. In the second step, GSH synthetase (Gsh2p) catalyzes the ligation of glycine with &gamma;-glutamylcysteine to form GSH. GSH is an essential reductant in yeast during normal metabolic processes |CITS: [8662189]|, but the dipeptide &gamma;-glutamylcysteine is able to substitute for GSH as an antioxidant |CITS: [9307967]|.
/
/GSH biosynthesis is co-regulated by Met4p, a transcription factor that induces expression of genes involved in sulfur assimilation, by Yap1p, a stress-responsive transcription factor, and by GSH feedback inhibition, which inhibits both GSH1 expression and Gsh1p enzyme activity |CITS: [12406228], [14514673]|.  Expression of GSH1 and GSH2 is induced by oxidative stress in a Yap1p-dependent manner with subsequent increases in intracellular GSH content |CITS: [7915005], [10809786]|.  GSH1 is also transcriptionally up-regulated by the heavy metal cadmium in the presence of Met4p and the DNA-binding proteins Met31p and Met32p |CITS: [9044254], [10921921]|.

COMMENT - Folates are heterocyclic compounds based on a pteroic acid skeleton conjugated to one or more glutamate molecules. The biologically active form of folate is tetrahydrofolate (THF), whose metabolic derivatives serve as cofactors that carry and chemically activate one-carbon (1C) units at different levels of oxidation (methyl-THF, methylene-THF, etc.) The 1C units carried by these folate cofactors are utilized in one-carbon metabolism for the biosynthesis of various compounds including methionine, thymidylate, and purines. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and many other microorganisms are able to synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo, unlike humans who must acquire it from the environment.
/
/In the folate biosynthesis pathway, chorismate is converted to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and coupled to a GTP-derived pteridine moiety to form 7,8-dihydropteroate. Dihydrofolate synthetase (encoded by FOL3 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>) subsequently adds a glutamate molecule to form 7,8-dihydrofolate, which is reduced by dihydrofolate reductase (Dfr1p) to tetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate can then be converted to one of the various 1C unit-carrying folate cofactors. Many of these cofactor forms, which differ in the position and the oxidation state of the 1C unit, mediate one-carbon transfer reactions in a specific biosynthetic pathway and can be enzymatically interconverted to one another. Furthermore, the folates produced in this pathway are subject to further glutamylation by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (Met7p), which catalyzes ATP-dependent extension of the glutamate side chain to yield folate polyglutamates. Polyglutamylation is thought to increase the affinity of intracellular folates for folate-dependent enzymes and prevent their efflux out of cells and organelles.

COMMENT - The thioredoxin and glutathione/glutaredoxin systems help maintain the reduced environment of the cell and play a significant role in defending the cell against oxidative stress.  They also have been proposed to play a role in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines as required for DNA synthesis, protein folding and regulation, and sulfur metabolism |CITS:[11169096],[2668278]|. 
/
/Thioredoxins and glutaredoxins are small heat-stable proteins with redox-active cysteines that facilitate the reduction of other proteins by catalyzing cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange reactions |CITS:[2668278]|. Thioredoxins contain two conserved cysteines that exist in either a reduced form as in thioredoxin-(SH)<sub>2</sub> or in an oxidized form as in thioredoxin-S<sub>2</sub> when they form an intramolecular disulfide bridge |CITS:[2668278]|. Thioredoxins donate electrons from their active center dithiol to protein disulfide bonds (Protein-S<sub>2</sub>) that are then reduced to dithiols (Protein-(SH)<sub>2</sub>). The resulting oxidized thioredoxin disulfide is reduced directly by thioredoxin reductase with electrons donated by NADPH |CITS:[2668278]|. Hence the thioredoxin reduction system consists of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH. Oxidized glutaredoxins, on the other hand, are reduced by the tripeptide glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly, known as GSH) using electrons donated by NADPH |CITS:[2668278]|. Hence the glutathione/glutaredoxin system consists of glutaredoxin, glutathione, glutathione reductase and NADPH. 
/
/S. cerevisiae contains a cytoplasmic thioredoxin system comprised of the thioredoxins Trx1p and Trx2p and the thioredoxin reductase Trr1p, 
/and a complete mitochondrial thioredoxin system comprised of the thioredoxin Trx3p and the thioredoxin reductase Trr2p |CITS:[15701801]|. Evidence suggests that the cytoplasmic thioredoxin system may have overlapping function with the glutathione/glutaredoxin system |CITS:[8930901], [10844700]|.  
/The mitochondrial thioredoxin system, on the other hand, does not appear to be able to substitute for either the cytoplasmic thioredoxin or glutathione/glutaredoxin 
/systems |CITS:[10844700]|. Instead, the mitochondrial thioredoxn proteins, thioredoxin (Trx3p) and thioredoxin reductase (Trr2p) have been implicated in the defense 
/against oxidative stress generated during respiratory metabolism |CITS:[10037727]|.
/
/The two cytoplasmic thioredoxins (Trx1p and Trx2p) are believed to supply reducing equivalents to the enzymes ribonucleotide reductase 
/(Rnr1p, Rnr2p, Rnr3p, Rnr4p) and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase (Met16p) |CITS:[4392601],[5442277]|. Deletion of either
/TRX1 or TRX2 has no effect on cell growth or morphology |CITS:[2026619]|, but, deletion of both genes affects the cell cycle, and makes the
/cells auxotrophic for methionine/cysteine |CITS:[2026619],[7929110]|.  Deletion of the single gene TRX2 does result in extreme sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
/and is thereby believed to be involved in the response against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[8313910]|. The expression of TRX2 and TRR1 are regulated by
/the transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7p in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[8313910],[9118942]|.

GSH is involved in many biological processes including: protein and DNA synthesis; amino acid transport; enzyme regulation; protection of cells against reactive oxygen compounds and free radicals, xenobiotics and heavy metals (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH can also be used as a source of sulfur and cysteine in |CITS: [1674526], [10514563]|.
/
/Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide and alkylperoxides produced by various metabolic processes can cause irreversible oxidative damage to the cell if they are not rapidly detoxified by antioxidant defenses. The redox-active sulphydryl group of GSH can protect cells from ROS by directly scavenging free radicals and acting as a cofactor for antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases (Gpx1p, Gpx2p and Gpx3p) |CITS: [10480913], [11445588], [15337745]|. Glutathione oxidized in this manner forms glutathione disulphide (GSSG), which is recycled back to GSH by the enzyme glutathione reductase (Glr1p) |CITS: [8843443]|. Some glutathione peroxidases such as Gpx2p, however, may be re-reduced by the thioredoxin system rather than the glutathione-glutaredoxin system |CITS: [16251189]|.
/
/GSH also protects the cell from xenobiotics and heavy metals through the formation of GSH S-conjugates and their subsequent export in the vacuole or directly out of the cell |CITS: [8990158], [8626454]|.  Some xenobiotics can react spontaneously with the thiol moiety of GSH to form GSH S-conjugates, while others react through GSH S-transferases (GST).  Two GSTs (Gtt1p and Gtt2p) were identified in yeast and shown to have GST activity with 1-chloro-2,4-dintrobenzene |CITS: [9792709]|. In yeast the GSH conjugates are transported to the vacuole by the GS-X pump Ycf1p |CITS: [8990158], [8626454], [10220408], [8626454], [12755704]| or directly out of the cell by other GS-X pumps |CITS: [10220408]|.

UNIQUE-ID - HOMOCYS-CYS-CONVERT

TYPES - Super-Pathways
COMMON-NAME - homocysteine and cysteine interconversion
CITATIONS - 9409150
COMMENT - The metabolic interconversion of cysteine and homocysteine via formation of a cystathionine intermediate is known as the transsulfuration pathway. While the transsulfuration pathway proceeds in only one direction in many bacteria and fungi, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> encodes for both a forward and reverse version of the pathway and is able to convert cysteine and homocysteine to one or the other reversibly. In the forward pathway, cysteine reacts with O-acetylhomoserine in a reaction catalyzed by cystathionine -synthase to form cystathionine. Cystathionine is then cleaved by cystathionine -lyase, yielding pyruvate, ammonia, and homocysteine. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, cystathionine -synthase and -lyase are thought to be encoded by STR2 and STR3 respectively, due to their similarity to the aforementioned enzymes in other organisms and the inability of str2 or str3 null mutants to utilize cysteine as a sole sulfur source. In the reverse pathway, cystathionine -synthase (Cys4p) catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine. Cystathionine -lyase (Cys3p) then catalyzes hydrolysis of cystathionine to produce cysteine, -ketobutyrate, and ammonia.
/
/The presence of two transsulfuration pathways in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> enables the cell to acquire methionine from cysteine and vice-versa by using homocysteine as an intermediate. Homocysteine derived from cysteine in the forward transsulfuration pathway can be converted to methionine, while homocysteine derived from methionine can be converted to cysteine via the reverse transsulfuration pathway. This enables <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to utilize methionine or cysteine as a sole source of sulfur.

COMMENT - Xylose is a pentose sugar and the second most abundant monosaccharide in nature. Because of the high abundance of xylose in wood and dry plant matter, engineering organisms for efficient fermentation of xylose to biofuel ethanol is of major industrial interest. Degradation of xylose in yeasts and filamentous fungi generally proceeds through its conversion to xylulose, phosphorylation to xylulose-5-phosphate, and subsequent metabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway. Although enzyme activities for all necessary steps in xylose utilization have been detected in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the conversion of xylose to xylulose does not occur in this organism at a rate sufficient for growth on xylose. As a consequence, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> can utilize xylulose but not xylose for growth and carbon in vivo.
/
/In xylose-utilizing yeasts, conversion of xylose to xylulose occurs in two steps: reduction of xylose to xylitol by xylose reductase, and oxidation of xylitol to xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the first step can be catalyzed by the unspecific aldose reductase Gre3p while the second step can be catalyzed by the xylitol dehydrogenase Xyl2p. Overexpression of both GRE3 and XYL2 enables <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to grow on xylose as the sole carbon source. Wild type <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cells accumulate xylitol when cultured on xylose, suggesting that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> metabolizes xylose to xylitol and little further in vivo. This may be due to the NAD+ requirement for xylitol dehydrogenase; NADH is thought to accumulate due to xylitol dehydrogenase activity and create a cofactor imbalance severe enough to obstruct to continuous conversion of xylitol to xylulose.

COMMON-NAME - NAD <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis II (from tryptophan)
CITATIONS - 12062417
COMMENT - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for cellular redox reactions and energy 
/metabolism.  NAD also has been shown to be an important substrate in a variety of biological processes, 
/including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling pathways, 
/calorie-restriction-mediated life-span extension and age-associated diseases |CITS: [12736687],[12648681]|. 
/NAD appears to affect these processes by regulating the Sir2p family of NAD-dependent deacetylases 
/(Sirtuins) |CITS: [12648681]|.
/
/There are a number of pathways for NAD biosynthesis.  In yeast and most other organisms, the two major 
/pathways are de novo synthesis of NAD (the de novo pathway) and regeneration of NAD from its 
/nicotinamide degradation products (the NAD salvage pathway) |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. NAD is 
/synthesized de novo from tryptophan via kynurenine |CITS: [12972620]|. In this pathway tryptophan is 
/converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in 6 enzymatic steps (catalyzed by Bna1-2p, and 
/Bna4-7p) and one non-enzymatic step |CITS: [12972620]|. At NAMN the de novo pathway converges with 
/the NAD salvage pathway and the last two steps to NAD are shared |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. In 
/the yeast NAD salvage pathway, the vitamin precursors nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are converted to 
/NAMN, the point of convergence with the de novo pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.  The steps from nicotinic 
/acid to NAD were elucidated by Preiss and Handler and are sometimes referred to as the Preiss-Handler 
/pathway |CITS: [13416279], [13563526]|. Yeast can also import extracellular nicotinic acid into the cell by 
/the permease Tna1p and then convert it into NAD via the Preiss-Handler pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.  
/
/There are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin 
/precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) 
/|CITS: [15137942], [17482543], [17914902]|. Three of these salvage pathways converge first with the NAD 
/salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway, while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is 
/independent of both of these pathways. In the NR salvage pathway I, NR is phosphorylated to 
/nicotinamide mononucleotide by the kinase Nrk1p, and then adenylated to NAD by Nma1p or Nma2p 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza that lack the enzymes of the de novo and 
/Preiss-Handler pathway can synthesize NAD from NR and nicotinamide mononucleotide as well 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Humans also appear to have this NR salvage pathway |CITS: [15137942]|. Yeast have 
/a second NR salvage pathway (NR salvage pathway II) that is independent of Nrk1p; in NR salvage 
/pathway II NR is split into a ribosyl product and nicotinamide, which is subsequently converted to NAD 
/via enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway and de novo pathway |CITS: [17482543]|. The initial steps in 
/the two NaR salvage pathways are similar to those of the NR salvage pathways and are catalyzed by the 
/same enzymes; Nrk1p catalyzes the first step in the NR and NaR salvage pathways I and Urh1p and 
/Pnp1p catalyze the first steps of the NR and NaR salvage pathways II |CITS: [17914902]|.

COMMON-NAME - trehalose degradation
CITATIONS - 11152943
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3334433681:eurie
COMMENT - Trehalose is a storage carbohydrate that can either be synthesized or obtained from the external environment. To be utilized as a carbon source, trehalase (EC:3.2.1.28) must convert trehalose and water into two molecules of glucose |CITS: 11152943|. S. cerevisiae has two trehalase enzymes, one is an acid trehalase encoded by ATH1 |CITS: 8764988| and the other is a neutral trehalase encoded by NTH1 |CITS: 8444853|. The name "acid" or "neutral" are based on the optimal pH of each enzyme (pH 4.5-5.0 and pH 6.8-7.0, respectively) |CITS: 11152943|. 
/
/
/Each trehalase enzyme is active in a different subcellular location.  Nth1p occurs as homodimer that is located in the cytoplasm, and is required for the hydrolysis of intracellular trehalose |CITS: 15128531|. Intracellular trehalose either results from trehalose biosynthesis, or to a lesser degree from uptake of trehalose from the environment via the Mal11p transporter. Ath1p was originally predicted to be a vacuolar protein, but has been experimentally shown to mainly localize in the periplasmic space, with a small fraction also occurring in the cell wall |CITS: 15128531|.  
/Extracellular trehalose is hydrolysed into 2 glucose molecules by Ath1p |CITS: 15128531|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of threonine and methionine biosynthesis
CITATIONS - HINNEBUSCH
COMMENT - The biosynthesis of threonine and methionine in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> begins in a common three-step pathway that converts aspartate to homoserine. HOM3 and HOM2, which encode the enzymes responsible for the first and second steps of this pathway respectively, are regulated by Gcn4p under the general control of amino acid biosynthesis. Additionally, threonine represses HOM3 and competitively inhibits homoserine dehydrogenase (encoded by HOM6), lending that the flow of carbon into the common pathway is primarily regulated by threonine. The Hom3p, Hom2p, and Hom6p-catalyzed reactions yield homoserine, at which point the threonine and methionine pathways diverge. Phosphorylation of homoserine by homoserine kinase (encoded by THR1) directs homoserine towards the biosynthesis of threonine, whereas acetylation by homoserine O-transacetylase (encoded by MET2) commits homoserine to the biosynthesis of sulfur amino acids.
/
/If homoserine is phosphorylated by homoserine kinase (Thr1p), threonine synthase (Thr4p) can subsequently catalyze its conversion to threonine. THR1 and THR4 are both transcriptionally regulated by general control of amino acid biosynthesis. Like Hom3p and Hom6p, homoserine kinase is also subject to feedback inhibition by threonine.
/
/If homoserine is acetylated by homoserine O-transacetylase (Met2p), it can enter one of two routes to be converted to homocysteine, the immediate precursor to methionine. In the first route, homocysteine is synthesized from the direct incorporation of sufide into O-acetylhomoserine via Met17p. In the second route, O-acetylhomoserine is condensed with cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway and subsequently cleaved, yielding homocysteine and pyruvate. Homocysteine can then accept a methyl group from a 1C unit-carrying derivative of tetrahydrofolate via Met6p to form methionine. When yeast cells are grown in methionine, synthesis of enzymes required for sulfate assimilation (which provides sulfide for homocysteine production) as well as methionine biosynthesis is repressed. Activation of most genes involved in the sulfur metabolic network (MET genes) requires the transcriptional activator Met4p. The activity of Met4p is regulated in response to the sulfur status of the cell, with cysteine levels serving as the major regulatory signal.

COMMON-NAME - pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 11154694
COMMENT - Pantothenate (vitamin B5) is a metabolic precursor to the essential cofactor coenzyme A. It is synthesized de novo in plants, eubacteria, archaea, and many fungi, but not in animals who instead must acquire it from the environment. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is able to synthesize pantothenate de novo, however some laboratory strains still require pantothenate supplementation in order to achieve optimal growth.
/
/Synthesis of pantothenate requires two precursors: pantoate and -alanine. The source of -alanine for this pathway varies by organism; whereas bacteria produce -alanine in one-step via the decarboxylation of aspartate, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> derives -alanine in two steps from spermine, a polyamine produced in the methionine salvage pathway. In the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> route, spermine is oxidized by amine oxidase (Fms1p) to form 3-aminopropanal, which is subsequently converted to -alanine by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald2p or Ald3p). Pantoate is synthesized from 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV), an intermediate in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. This occurs in two steps in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: hydroxymethylation of 2-KIV via Ecm31p to form ketopantoate, and reduction of ketopantoate to pantoate via Pan5p. After its production, pantoate can be condensed with -alanine in a reaction catalyzed by pantothenate synthetase (Pan6p) to form pantothenate. Pantothenate may then go on to react with cysteine and ATP in a five-step pathway leading up to the synthesis of coenzyme A.

COMMENT - <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, as a Crabtree-positive yeast, predominantly ferments pyruvate to ethanol in high glucose conditions. When glucose or other preferred carbon sources are depleted, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> switches to aerobic respiration and utilizes ethanol as carbon source instead, a phenomenon known as diauxic shift. Ethanol degradation is a three-step pathway that begins with the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD) then converts acetaldehyde to acetate, which acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) subsequently ligates with coenzyme A to produce acetyl-CoA. 
/
/Alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase each have several isozymes in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Of the alcohol dehydrogenases involved in catalyzing interconversion between ethanol and acetaldehyde, the cytosolic enzyme Adh2p is thought to preferentially catalyze ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde due to its relatively low Km for ethanol. ADH2 is glucose-repressed and activated by Cat8p and Adr1p. The oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate is catalyzed by both cytosolic and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, of which the main isoforms (Ald6p and Ald4p, respectively) are important for growth on ethanol.

COMMENT - Saccharomyces cerevisiae can grow on acetoin and 2,3-butanediol as the sole carbon and energy sources, indicating S. cerevisiae's ability to degrade these metabolites |CITS: [10938079]|.  Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are both by-products of alcoholic fermentation by S. cerevisiae and other wine yeasts.  Various lines of evidence suggest that Bdh1p catalyzes the first step in 2,3-butanediol degradation, the oxidation of 2,3-butanediol to acetoin |CITS: [10938079]|.  However, S. cerevisiae mutants with a disrupted BDH1 gene can still grow on 2,3-butanediol as the sole carbon and energy source, indicating that there are other enzymes that can metabolize 2,3-butanediol |CITS: [10938079]|).  How acetoin is further degraded in S. cerevisiae is not yet known.  Many prokaryotes have a multienzyme complex, acetoin dehydrogenase , that is similar to pyruvate dehdrogenase and transforms acetoin into acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, which can enter the glyoxylate and TCA cycle (as reported in |CITS: [11306064]|).

COMMENT - Fructose is a six-carbon ketose that can be used as a fermentable carbon source in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Utilization of fructose begins with its uptake via hexose transporter (Hxt) family proteins. Of the 20 different Hxt-related proteins in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, Hxt1p-4p, 6p, and 7p are the most important for glucose, fructose, and mannose uptake. Once inside the cell, fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by the hexokinases Hxk1p and Hxk2p. Although both kinases can catalyze this reaction, only HXK2 is expressed when fructose is the carbon source. HXK1 expression occurs in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources or galactose. F6P, in addition to being an intermediate in glycolysis, may also be utilized in yeast to synthesize UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, a building block for major structural components of the fungal cell wall.

COMMENT - Xylulose is a pentose sugar and a fermentable carbon source in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. While xylulose is not abundant in nature, many organisms produce it as an intermediate in metabolism of xylose, the most naturally abundant sugar after glucose. In many xylose-utilizing species of yeast, degradation of xylose proceeds through its conversion to xylulose, phosphorylation to xylulose-5-phosphate, and subsequent metabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway. Although enzyme activities for all necessary steps in xylose utilization have been detected in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the conversion of xylose to xylulose does not occur at a rate sufficient for growth on xylose in this species. As a consequence, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> can utilize xylulose but not xylose for growth and carbon in vivo.
/
/<i>S. cerevisiae</i> ferments xylulose at a rate ten times lower than for glucose. The rate-limiting step of xylulose utilization is catalyzed by xylulokinase (Xks1p), which phosphorylates xylulose for subsequent incorporation into the pentose phosphate pathway. XKS1 expression in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is generally low and is not induced in the presence of xylose or xylulose. While some studies show that overexpressing XKS1 improves growth on xylulose, others report that XKS1 overexpression is toxic when cells are grown on xylulose as the sole carbon source.

COMMENT - Mannose is a fermentable six-carbon monosaccharide that can be utilized for carbon and energy in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. It is also required for many important mannosylation reactions in the cell, including those involved in N-linked and O-linked glycosylation of proteins and synthesis of the lipid anchor glycosylphosphatidylinositol. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, utilization of mannose begins with its phosphorylation to mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) by hexokinase (Hxk1p or Hxk2p) or glucokinase (Glk1p). Although all three proteins can phosphorylate mannose, only HXK2 is highly expressed when yeast cells are grown on mannose as a carbon source. M6P can either be converted to GDP-mannose to support mannosylation reactions in the cell, or converted to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to fuel glycolysis. The conversion of M6P to F6P is reversible and catalyzed in both directions by mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Pmi40p). When yeast cells are grown on mannose as the sole carbon source, PMI40 transcription increases 12-fold, likely in order to provide sufficient levels of F6P for glycolysis. In the absence of mannose, Pmi40p activity becomes is essential for growth, as it enables <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to synthesize M6P from glucose or other carbon sources of F6P.

COMMENT - Yeast and most other microorganisms initiate the degradation of galactose via the enzymes of the Leloir pathway, which convert galactose into glucose-6-phosphate for subsequent entry into glycolysis. In the yeast Leloir pathway, galactokinase (Gal1p) phosphorylates galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. Galactokinase is specific for the -anomer of galactose; if the galactose substrate is in the -form, then it must first be converted to the -form through the mutarotase activity of Gal10p. After its conversion to galactose-1-phosphate, galactose is subsequently swapped with a glucose moiety from UDP-glucose via Gal7p, forming UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. The glucose-1-phosphate product can then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate, a substrate of glycolysis, via phosphoglucomutase (Pgm2p or Pgm1p). On the other hand, the UDP-galactose product- which contains carbon from the original galactose substrate- can be converted to UDP-glucose via the epimerase activity of Gal10p. The glucose unit of this UDP-glucose molecule may then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate during a second round of the Leloir pathway.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the genes involved in the Leloir pathway- GAL1, GAL7, and GAL10- are transcriptionally regulated in response to galactose by Gal4p, Gal80p, and Gal3p. Gal4p functions as a transcriptional activator of GAL genes, whereas Gal80p functions to inhibit this activity by binding to Gal4p in the absence of galactose. In the presence of galactose, Gal3p binds to Gal80p in an ATP-dependent manner and relieves inhibition of Gal4p, resulting in GAL gene expression.

COMMENT - Polyamines are low molecular weight aliphatic cations present in all types of living organisms. They are essential in all eukaryotes and likely essential in archaea, while in bacteria their requirement for growth varies. Polyamines are known to be involved in several biological processes, including post-translational modification of eIF5A in eukaryotes and biofilm formation in some bacteria. However, their role in the cell is not completely understood. The most common polyamines are putrescine, spermidine, and spermine.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the biosynthesis of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine begins with two intermediates from amino acid metabolism: ornithine, an intermediate of arginine biosynthesis and degradation, and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a metabolite of methionine and a ubiquitous methyl group donor for many biological reactions. At the start of the pathway, ornithine is decarboxylated to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (Spe1p) while S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (Spe2p) decarboxylates AdoMet. Spermidine synthase (Spe3p) then catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl group from decarboxylated AdoMet to putrescine, converting the two substrates to 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and spermidine, respectively. In an analogous reaction, spermidine can go on to react with decarboxylated AdoMet via spermine synthase (Spe4p) to yield spermine and another molecule of MTA. Spermidine but not spermine is essential for growth in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.
/
/MTA, a major byproduct of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, is also the principal substrate for the methionine salvage pathway. The methionine salvage pathway recycles MTA produced during polyamine biosynthesis or other cellular processes back into methionine. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the polyamine biosynthesis pathway and the methionine salvage pathway together are estimated to account for 11-19% of the methionine used by a methionine auxotroph grown on limiting methionine.

/Under all of the above conditions, glycogen is degraded by Gph1p and Gdb1p enzymes, which are phosphorylase and debranching enzymes respectively |CITS: 11152943|.   GPH1 progressively releases glucose-1-phosphate from linear alpha (1,4)-glucosidic bonds in glycogen |CITS: 2657401||CITS: 1092346| but is not able to break alpha (1,4)-glucosidic bonds that are close to alpha (1,6)-branch linkages |CITS: 11152943|. The branches are resolved by Gdb1p, which eliminates branch points in a two-step process. The first step of the process is the transfer of a maltotriosyl (or maltosyl) unit from the branch to an adjacent alpha-1,4-glucosyl chain by the oligo-1,4 to 1,4-glucanotransferase activity (EC 2.4.1.25) of Gdb1p |CITS: 11094287|. The second step is the subsequent hydrolysis of the residual alpha-1,6-linked glucose residue by the alpha-1,6-glucosidase activity (EC 3.2.1.33) of Gdb1p |CITS: 11094287|. Once the branch is resolved, Gph1p can continue glycogen degradation |CITS: 11152943|.
/
/In sporulating cells, glycogen can also be degraded by Sga1p, which is a glucoamylase enzyme only expressed during late sporulation |CITS: 11152943|. SGA1 encodes an amylo (1,4-1,6)-glucosidase |CITS: 11152943| capable of degrading glycogen, starch, maltotriose, and maltose into glucose, with maximum activity against glycogen at pH 5.5 |CITS: 2493265|. The role of glycogen degradation during sporulation is not fully understood, since glycogen is rapidly degraded during sporulation in wild-type cells, but approximately 90% of all sga1 homozygous null mutants are able to produce viable spores |CITS: 11152943|.
/
/Thus far, none of the phenotypes seen in S. cerevisiae glycogen catabolism mutants correspond to the mammalian glycogen storage diseases associated with mutations in human genes involved in glycogen catabolism |CITS: 11152943|.

COMMENT - In eukaryotes, N-linked (asparagine-linked) glycosylation is the most common form of protein modification of secretory and membrane proteins, and is involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as protein folding, sorting and stability (reviewed in |CITS: [15189166][8472892][3896128]|). 
/
/The initial steps of N-linked glycosylation, which are also known as the dolichol pathway of N-linked glycosylation, and lipid- and dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, involve the synthesis of a core oligosaccharide (glucosyl)<sub>3</sub>(mannosyl)<sub>9</sub>(N-acetylglucosamine)<sub>2</sub>, abbreviated, Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, on the lipid carrier, dolichol-pyrophosphate (Dol-PP) (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760][8472892][3896128]|).  The ordered assembly of the core oligosaccharide is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. The assembly starts on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-phosphate) is transferred from uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to dolichol-phosphate (Dol-P) followed by the addition of one N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and five mannose residues from UDP-GlcNAc and guanosine 5'-diphosphomannose (GDP-Man), respectively. The resulting lipid-linked precursor (Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol) is translocated "flipped" into the lumen of the ER by a flippase, which which is endoded by <i>RFT1</i> in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.  Once in the lumen, the oligosaccharide is extended by four mannose and three glucose residues derived from dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) and dolichyl-phosphate-glucose (Dol-P-Glc), respectively. The enzyme complex oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) transfers the preassembled oligosaccharide, Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, from the lipid carrier Dol-PP to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides as the polypeptides pass into the lumen of the ER |CITS: [11580295]||CITS: [9405463]|.  
/
/Once attached to the protein, the N-linked oligosaccharide is further modified by a series of trimming and elongation reactions beginning in the ER and ending in the late Golgi compartment |CITS: [8054711]|. In the ER, the oligosaccharide is trimmed of its 3 glucose residues and a specific mannose residue to form Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>. The glucose residues are removed by glucosidases I and II, and in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> the mannose is removed by the alpha-1,2-mannosidase Mns1p, which is part of the editing mechanism that promotes the exit of correctly folded glycoproteins from the ER |CITS: [9732283]|.  Once the four monosaccharides are removed, the glycoproteins are transported from the ER to the Golgi, where the yeast and mammalian pathways diverge |CITS: [3304149]|.
/
/The lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway is of particular interest in humans, because defects in the glycosyltransferases involved lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation |CITS: [11306275][17024709]|.

COMMENT - The first step of glycolysis is the irreversible phosphorylation of glucose at C6. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, this reaction is catalyzed by the hexokinases Hxk1p and Hxk2p and the glucokinase Glk1p. Any single one of these enzymes is sufficient for growth on glucose, however Hxk2p appears to be the main glucose-phosphorylating isoenzyme. While HXK2 is expressed in glucose, both HXK1 and GLK1 are glucose-repressed, and expression of GLK1 and HXK1 occurs at significant levels only in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources or galactose. Hxk2p is thought to have dual functions depending on localization: cytosolic Hxk2p is a glycolytic enzyme, whereas nuclear Hxk2p is a transcriptional regulator involved in glucose-induced repression of HXK1 and GLK1 and glucose-induced expression of HXK2. In addition to glucose-mediated transcriptional regulation, the hexokinase step of glycolysis is also subject to allosteric control. Yeast hexokinase is strongly inhibited by high ATP concentrations and competitively inhibited by trehalose-6-phosphate. Enzyme regulation of hexokinase is thought to play an important role in the control of glycolytic flux in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.

COMMON-NAME - dolichyl glucosyl phosphate biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 9878760

COMMENT - In the dolichol pathway of N-linked glycosylation, an oligosaccharide consisting of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), nine mannosyl, and three glucosyl residues (abbreviated GlcNAc2Man9Glc3) is assembled on the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate (Dol-PP). This assembly is catalyzed by several groups of glycosyltransferases, each using a different nucleotide-activated or Dol-P-bound sugar as their donor substrate. One such substrate is Dol-P-glucose, which provides glucose residues for assembly of the terminal Glc3 cap on the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO).
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, Dol-P-glucose is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) in three steps: conversion of G6P to glucose-1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase (Pgm1p or Pgm2p), formation of UDP-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate and UTP via UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Ugp1p), and transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to Dol-P by UDP-glucose:dolichyl-phosphate glucosyltransferase (Alg5p). After its production, Dol-P-glucose may serve as substrate for the glycosyltransferases Alg6p, Alg8p, and Die2p/Alg10p within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These enzymes catalyze the sequential addition of three glucose residues, each derived from a molecule of Dol-P-glucose, to the growing LLO during the final steps of LLO biosynthesis.

COMMENT - In the dolichol pathway of N-linked glycosylation, an oligosaccharide consisting of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), nine mannosyl, and three glucosyl residues (abbreviated GlcNAc2Man9Glc3) is assembled on the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate (Dol-PP). The ordered assembly of this lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) begins on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and concludes within the lumen of the ER. Two distinct molecules provide the mannose units required for assembly of the LLO: GDP-mannose and Dol-P-mannose. GDP-mannose provides the first five mannose units attached to the LLO during the cytoplasmic phase, whereas Dol-P-mannose provides the final four units during the ER lumenal phase. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, Dol-P-mannose is synthesized from GDP-mannose and dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) while GDP-mannose is synthesized from GDP and fructose-6-phosphate.

/The pathway for the synthesis of GDP-mannose from fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) occurs in three steps in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: isomerization of F6P to mannose-6-phosphate by phosphomannoisomerase (Pmi40p), conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate by phosphomannomutase (Sec53p), and conversion of mannose-1-phosphate and GDP to GDP-mannose via mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (Psa1p). During the cytoplasmic phase of LLO biosynthesis, GDP-mannose molecules are used by a series of glycosyltransferases (Alg1p, Alg2p, and Alg11p) to add five mannosyl residues to Dol-PP-GlcNAc2. Alternatively, GDP-mannose can donate its sugar unit to Dol-P via Dol-P-mannose synthase (Dpm1p), forming Dol-P-mannose. Molecules of Dol-P-mannose are used by a second group of glycosyltransferases (Alg3p, Alg9p, and Alg12p) during the ER lumenal phase to add the four final mannoses to Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man5.

COMMENT - The tripeptide glutathione (GSH: L-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is a prevalent intracellular thiol that is able to act as a cellular redox buffer due to its low redox potential (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH is involved in many biological processes including: protein and DNA synthesis; amino acid transport; enzyme regulation; protection of cells against reactive oxygen compounds and free radicals, xenobiotics and heavy metals (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH can also be used as a source of sulfur and cysteine in |CITS: [1674526], [10514563]|.
/
/Plants and animals metabolize GSH via the &gamma;-glutamyl cycle.  Whether or not this complete cycle exists in yeast and other microorganisms is open to debate |CITS: [5076], [JASPERS85]|. The two enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of GSH from its constituent amino acids, &gamma;-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Gsh1p) and GSH synthetase (Gsh2p), are present in yeast (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|).  Yeast was also found to have &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase (Ecm38p) and cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (CGase) |CITS: [JASPERS85]|, two vacuolar-membrane-bound enzymes that are proposed to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of GSH to its constitutive amino acids |CITS: [6143574], [11672438]|. Although enzymatic activity for CGase was observed in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [JASPERS85]|, the open reading frame for CGase has yet to be identified in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The presence of the remaining two &gamma;-glutamyl cycle enzymes, &gamma;-glutamyl cyclotransferase and 5-oxoprolinase, is still in question |CITS: [5076], [JASPERS85]|, suggesting that yeast may only have a truncated &gamma;-glutamyl cycle.
/
/<i>S. cerevisiae</i> also has been proposed to have an alternative pathway for degrading GSH that involves a novel GSH degradosomal protein complex comprised of the three gene products Dug1p, Dug2p, and Dug3p |CITS: [17179087]|.

/<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is believed to hydrolyze GSH to its constitutive amino acids glutamate, cysteine and glycine in two steps catalyzed by the vacuolar-membrane-bound enzymes, &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase (Ecm38p) and cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (CGase), respectively |CITS: [JASPERS85], [6143574], [11672438]|.

/but they are increased in the presence of other nitrogen sources, such as amino acids and urea |CITS: [6102906]|. Ecm38p production is derepressed during nitrogen starvation |CITS: [9202464]|.

COMMENT - The utilization of ammonia to synthesize glutamate occurs through two pathways in most microorganisms. In the first pathway, glutamate is synthesized through the reductive amination of -ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase. Two NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases exist in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: Gdh1p and Gdh3p. GDH1 is highly expressed when either ethanol or glucose is used as the carbon source, whereas GDH3 is glucose-repressed and induced only in ethanol. The second route of glutamate biosynthesis involves the combined action of glutamine synthetase (Gln1p) and glutamate synthase (Glt1p). In the first step, glutamate reacts with a molecule of ammonia in a reaction catalyzed by Gln1p to form glutamine. In the second, glutamine reacts with -ketoglutarate via Glt1p to form two molecules of glutamate, resulting in a net gain of one for each glutamate molecule that enters the pathway.

COMMENT - Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules that consist of a glycerol backbone esterified to a phosphate group and two fatty acids. As a primary structural element of biological membranes, phospholipids play important roles in cell morphology and organelle function. The major phospholipids found in total cell extracts from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS); however, the phospholipid composition of yeast changes according to the carbon source used for growth.
/
/All major phospholipid classes in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> may trace their synthesis to a common precursor: cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). CDP-DAG is synthesized in a reaction catalyzed by CDP-DAG synthase, which converts phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-DAG using cytidine triphosphate (CTP) as the CDP donor. There are two distinct CDP-DAG synthases in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: Cds1p, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Tam41p, localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In the ER, CDP-DAG generated by Cds1p can be converted to phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS) via PI synthase (Pis1p) or PS synthase (Cho1p), respectively. In the mitochondrion, CDP-DAG generated by Tam41p can be sequentially converted to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which can be further converted to cardiolipin. Synthesis of PI, PG, and cardiolipin occurs through similar mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, unlike yeast, mammals primarily synthesize PS from other phospholipids and not from CDP-DAG.
/
/PS generated via Pis1p may undergo further processing in the mitochondria, where the enzyme PS decarboxylase (Psd1p) can convert it to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). This represents the major route of PE synthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The second route occurs via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway. This pathway consists of three steps: 1) phosphorylation of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine by ethanolamine kinase (Eki1p) or choline kinase (Cki1p), 2) activation of phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine by phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Ect1p), and 3) transfer of a phosphoethanolamine moiety from CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol by 1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase (Ept1p). The other branch of the Kennedy pathway, the CDP-choline pathway, incorporates choline into phosphatidylcholine (PC) in three analogous steps. PC may also be synthesized from PE when the latter molecule undergoes three successive methylations by Cho2p and Opi3p.

COMMENT - Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides serve many diverse and essential roles in the cell. They are precursors to DNA, RNA, and many important metabolites (e.g. CDP-diacylglycerol). In addition, nucleotides can be used as an energy source (primarily as ATP), signaling molecules, and cofactor components (e.g. coenzyme A).
/
/In yeast and most eukaryotes, purine nucleotides levels are maintained via a combination of de novo synthesis and salvage pathways. The salvage pathways utilize purine bases and nucleosides taken up from the environment or formed from metabolism to synthesize purine nucleoside monophosphates. Compared to the de novo pathway, where 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is converted to the adenylic/guanylic nucleotide precursor inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP) over many ATP-consuming steps, the salvage pathways synthesize IMP, GMP, and AMP directly from PRPP and a purine base via the action of purine phosphoribosyltransferases. 
/
/When purines are abundant in the growth medium, the salvage pathways are the preferred routes of purine nucleotide synthesis. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, most of the ADE genes responsible for de novo synthesis of IMP and AMP are repressed in response to extracellular adenine, whereas extracellular guanine strongly represses the IMD genes responsible for the rate-limiting step of GMP synthesis. Adenine limitation, on the other hand, results in derepression of ADE genes and active de novo purine biosynthesis. Adenine-repressible transcriptional activation of ADE genes is mediated by the transcription factors Bas1p and Pho2p.

COMMENT - The reactions of the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway are reversible and are important for generating ribose-5-phosphate, which is required for the biosynthesis of several biomolecules, including RNA and DNA. These reactions also catalyze the interconversion of a variety of 3, 5 and 6 carbon sugars, which is important for several biosynthetic pathways, including the biosynthesis of pyrimidines, purines, tryptophan, histidine, and aromatic amino acids |CITS:[8929392]||CITS:[15960801]||CITS:[7916691]||CITS:[14690456]|. The flow of glucose 6-phosphate through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway is linked through two enzymes of the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, transketolase (Tkl1p and Tkl2p) and transaldolase (Tal1p). The ability of these enzymes to convert one type of sugar into another allows them to convert the byproduct of one pathway into the substrate of another pathway in order to meet the metabolic needs of the cell. For example, if the cell needs ribose 5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate will be converted to ribose 5-phosphate. If the cell needs NADPH or ATP more than ribose 5-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate for use by the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway or glycolysis, respectively |CITS:[11298766]||CITS:[15960801]||CITS:[1628611]|.

COMMENT - Many organisms possess sulfur salvage pathways that enable recovery of the reduced sulfur atom in metabolites of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) after AdoMet is consumed in a metabolic reaction. The methionine salvage pathway, also known as the 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) cycle, is one such example. The MTA cycle regenerates methionine from the AdoMet metabolite 5-methylthioadenosine/MTA, which is formed predominantly as a byproduct of polyamine biosynthesis. The methionine salvage pathway is present in all types of organisms, and may have evolved to reuse sulfur after its costly assimilation into the cell.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, biosynthesis of the polyamines spermidine and spermine account for over 98% of MTA produced by the cell. In the polyamine pathway, decarboxylated AdoMet (derived from methionine) is converted to MTA after losing an aminopropyl group to putrescine via spermidine synthase (Spe3p). This converts putrescine to spermidine, which can likewise react with decarboxylated AdoMet via spermine synthase (Spe4p) to form spermine and another molecule of MTA. The MTA produced by these two reactions can then enter the MTA cycle to be converted back to methionine.

COMMENT - The pentose phosphate pathway is important for generating NADPH,  which is a source of reducing energy, as well as a variety of sugar  molecules that are required for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and  amino acids. |CITS:[8929392]||CITS:[8910528]||CITS:[9813062]||CITS:[ 11298766]||CITS:[1628611]||CITS:[15960801]||CITS:[7916691]||CITS:[14690456]|.  This pathway is also important for protecting yeast from oxidative  stress, since NADPH is an essential cofactor for glutathione- and  thioredoxin-dependent enzymes that defend cells against oxidative  damage |CITS:[8929392]||CITS:[8910528]||CITS:[11557322]||CITS:[16179340]|.
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is of industrial interest for the fermentation of xylose to ethanol |CITS:[11916674]|. Xylose is the predominant sugar found in biomass such as agricultural wastes, wood, municipal solid wastes, and wastes from pulp and paper industries,  and possibly could serve as a low-cost and abundant raw material for  fuel ethanol production |CITS:[8534086]|. Saccharomyces cerevisiae does  not naturally metabolize xylose, but recombinant S. cerevisiae  strains containing the xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase  genes from Pichia stipitis are able to metabolize xylose via the  pentose phosphate pathway |CITS:[15630585]||CITS:[8534086]|. Changes in  the levels of enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway effect the  fitness, ethanol production, and amount of xylose metabolized by  these recombinant xylose-utilizing strains.

/The pentose phosphate pathway is also of medical interest because mutations in the human homologs of some yeast pentose phosphate genes  are associated with a variety of diseases.  Zwf1p is homologus to  human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which has been  implicated in neonatal jaundice and haemolytic anemia. Sol3p and  Sol4p have similarity to human PGLS, which is associated with 6- phosphogluconolactonase deficiency and may contribute to some forms  of G6PD-associated hemolytic anemia |CITS:[10518023]|.

COMMENT - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for cellular redox reactions and energy 
/metabolism.  NAD also has been shown to be an important substrate in a variety of biological processes, 
/including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling pathways, 
/calorie-restriction-mediated life-span extension and age-associated diseases 
/|CITS: [12736687],[12648681]|. NAD appears to affect these processes by regulating the Sir2p family of 
/NAD-dependent deacetylases (Sirtuins) |CITS: [12648681]|. 
/
/There are a number of pathways for NAD biosynthesis.  In yeast and most other organisms, the two major 
/pathways are de novo synthesis of NAD (the de novo pathway) and regeneration of NAD from its 
/nicotinamide degradation products (the NAD salvage pathway) |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. NAD is 
/synthesized de novo from tryptophan via kynurenine |CITS: [12972620]|. In this pathway tryptophan is 
/converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in 6 enzymatic steps (catalyzed by Bna1-2p, and 
/Bna4-7p) and one non-enzymatic step |CITS: [12972620]|. At NAMN the de novo pathway converges with 
/the NAD salvage pathway and the last two steps to NAD are shared |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. In 
/the yeast NAD salvage pathway, the vitamin precursors nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are converted to 
/NAMN, the point of convergence with the de novo pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.  The steps from nicotinic 
/acid to NAD were elucidated by Preiss and Handler and are sometimes referred to as the Preiss-Handler 
/pathway |CITS: [13416279], [13563526]|. Yeast can also import extracellular nicotinic acid into the cell by 
/the permease Tna1p and then convert it into NAD via the Preiss-Handler pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.
/
/There are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin 
/precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) 
/|CITS: [15137942], [17482543], [17914902]|. Three of these salvage pathways converge first with the NAD 
/salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway, while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is 
/independent of both of these pathways. In the NR salvage pathway I, NR is phosphorylated to 
/nicotinamide mononucleotide by the kinase Nrk1p, and then adenylated to NAD by Nma1p or Nma2p 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza that lack the enzymes of the de novo and 
/Preiss-Handler pathway can synthesize NAD from NR and nicotinamide mononucleotide as well 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Humans also appear to have this NR salvage pathway |CITS: [15137942]|. Yeast have 
/a second NR salvage pathway (NR salvage pathway II) that is independent of Nrk1p; in NR salvage 
/pathway II NR is split into a ribosyl product and nicotinamide, which is subsequently converted to NAD 
/via enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway and de novo pathway |CITS: [17482543]|. The initial steps in 
/the two NaR salvage pathways are similar to those of the NR salvage pathways and are catalyzed by the 
/same enzymes; Nrk1p catalyzes the first step in the NR and NaR salvage pathways I and Urh1p and 
/Pnp1p catalyze the first steps of the NR and NaR salvage pathways II |CITS: [17914902]|.

COMMENT - The reactions of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway occur in the cytosol and are important for generating NADPH through the oxidative reduction of NADP+. NADPH is an important source of the reducing energy required by many enzymes in central biosynthetic pathways  |CITS:[8929392]| |CITS:[8910528]| |CITS:[9813062]| |CITS:[11298766]| |CITS:[1628611]|. Although there are other biochemical pathways that generate NADPH in yeast, the pentose phosphate pathway is considered the major source of NADPH, and insufficient NADPH probably contributes to  the fitness defects seen in mutants of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway |CITS:[12047390]| |CITS:[15960801]|. Because NADPH is an essential 
/cofactor for glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent enzymes that  defend cells against oxidative damage, 
/the oxidative branch of the  pentose phosphate pathway is also important for protecting yeast from 
/oxidative stress |CITS:[8929392]||CITS:[8910528]||CITS:[11557322]||CITS:[16179340]|. 
/
/Metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway varies according to the metabolic needs of the cell |CITS:[10803891]| |CITS:[15066826]|. The first reaction of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway is irreversible, and is the rate limiting reaction for the entire pentose phosphate pathway |CITS:[12047390]|. Although Zwf1p expression in yeast is essentially constitutive |CITS:[16179340]|, Zwf1p activity is inhibited by NADPH and stimulated by processes that decrease the cytosolic levels of NADPH |CITS:[ 3277619]|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of glucose fermentation
CITATIONS - 6985717
COMMENT - Glycolysis consists of ten reactions that can be conceptually split into an energy investment and phase and an energy-producing phase. In the initial energy investment phase, 2 molecules of ATP are consumed to convert glucose into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In the downstream energy producing phase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is then broken down into two 3-carbon sugars that are each converted into a molecule of pyruvate. 2 ATP and 1 NADH are produced for each 3-carbon sugar converted to pyruvate, therefore glycolysis nets 2 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 pyruvate molecules for each glucose fed through the pathway.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, further degradation of pyruvate can occur via respiration or fermentation. The respiration pathway involves the complete oxidation of pyruvate to CO2 via pyruvate dehydrogenase and the TCA cycle, yielding ATP and reduced cofactors (e.g. NADH) that can be oxidized in the mitochondria to produce more ATP. In the fermentation pathway, pyruvate is decarboxylated by pyruvate decarboxylase to acetaldehyde, which is then reduced to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase. The respiratory pathway in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> yields approximately 16 ATP per glucose, whereas the fermentation pathway results in a net gain of only two ATP per glucose. Despite the greater ATP-to-glucose ratio afforded by the respiration pathway, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> nevertheless ferments glucose in the presence of oxygen when this sugar is abundant in the growth medium. This phenomenon- the fermentation of sugar under aerobic conditions- is referred to as the Crabtree effect.
/
/In the respiratory pathway, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, because <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is unable to transport acetyl-CoA from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm, this organism utilizes an alternative, cytosolic pathway known as the PDH bypass to generate cytosolic acetyl-CoA from pyruvate by using acetate as an intermediate. The PDH bypass involves the concerted action of pyruvate decarboxylase, which converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde; acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which oxidizes acetaldehyde to acetate; and acetyl-CoA synthetase, which ligates acetate with coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA. The PDH bypass is the source of the acetate that accumulates in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cultures when shifted from glucose limitation to glucose excess.

COMMENT - Many yeast and bacterial species ferment pyruvate to 2,3-butanediol via the intermediate, acetoin.  Although acetoin is a flavorless compound, it is a precursor to some off-odor compounds, such as diacetyl, which can be unfavorable in beer and wine.  Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are both by-products of alcoholic fermentation by S. cerevisiae and other wine yeasts. Acetoin production during alcoholic fermentation depends on the yeast strain and other variables such as substrate and temperature (as reported in |CITS: [16535224]|). Wine yeasts with high fermentation power generally produce low acetoin levels and large amounts of ethanol and higher alcohols (alcohols with more than 2 carbons) (as reported in |CITS: [16535224]|).

COMMENT - Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a central intermediate in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, de novo synthesis of PA occurs primarily through two acylation pathways: the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway and the dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) pathway. In both routes of PA synthesis, G3P and DHAP are converted to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and subsequently acylated to PA by 1-acyl-sn-G3P acyltransferases (Slc1p, Ale1p, and Loa1p). G3P/DHAP acyltransferases (Sct1p and Gpt2p) catalyze the first step in both pathways, acylating G3P to LPA or DHAP to 1-acyl-DHAP. Further conversion of 1-acyl-DHAP to LPA occurs via a NADPH-dependent reaction catalyzed by 1-acyl-DHAP reductase (Ayr1p). After its formation from LPA, PA can be cleaved to diacylglycerol by phosphatidate phosphatases (Pah1p, Dpp1p, Lpp1p, and App1p) for the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols. Alternatively, PA can be converted by CDP-DAG synthases (Cds1p and Tam41p) to cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), the precursor to all major phospholipids in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.
/
/The universal route of PA biosynthesis is the G3P pathway, which exists in prokaryotes, plants, yeast, and mammalian cells. In contrast, the DHAP pathway is present only in yeast and mammals. Aside from these de novo pathways, PA synthesis may also occur through alternative routes such as phosphorylation of diacylglycerol by DAG kinase (Dgk1p in yeast) and hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D (Spo14p in yeast).

COMMENT - Biotin (vitamin H) is an essential vitamin for all organisms. It is a cofactor for many carboxylases, including those involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism. The ability to synthesize biotin varies among strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>; many isolates, including the reference genome strain S288c, do not encode a complete biotin biosynthesis pathway and are incapable of growth in medium lacking biotin. In biotin-producing strains such as A364a, the genes involved in the full pathway have been putatively identified as BIO1 through BIO6. Strain S288c retains only BIO2 through BIO4 and is a biotin auxotroph; if both BIO1 and BIO6 are expressed in this strain, it regains biotin prototrophy.
/
/The four steps of the biotin biosynthesis pathway have been elucidated in bacteria. First, KAPA synthase catalyzes the decarboxylative condensation of alanine and pimeloyl-CoA to form 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). Second, KAPA receives an amino group from S-adenosylmethionine via DAPA aminotransferase to form 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA). Third, dethiobiotin synthetase catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of dethiobiotin from DAPA and CO2. Lastly, biotin synthase inserts a sulfur atom between carbons C6 and C9 on dethiobiotin, forming biotin. The enzymes that catalyze these four reactions in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are encoded by BIO6, BIO3, BIO4, and BIO2, respectively. Additionally, the KAPA precursor pimeloyl-CoA is presumed to be synthesized in yeast by the putative pimeloyl-CoA synthetase Bio1p.

COMMENT - Tetrapyrroles are a group of molecules that contain of four pyrrole rings linked together by single-atom bridges in a cyclic or linear arrangement. Biologically important cyclic tetrapyrroles, such as chlorophyll, cobalamin, heme, and siroheme, coordinate a metal ion in their central cavity and function as cofactors in numerous biological processes. The iron-containing tetrapyrroles siroheme and heme function in sulfur assimilation and oxygen sensing/utilization respectively. Both are synthesized de novo via the intermediary formation of uroporphyrinogen-III in the budding yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.
/
/Like in mammals and photosynthetic bacteria, de novo synthesis of tetrapyrroles in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> begins with the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA to 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). In many plants and prokaryotes however, ALA is instead synthesized from the 5-carbon chain of glutamate. After two ALA molecules are produced, they can be condensed by ALA dehydratase (Hem2p in yeast) to form porphobilinogen (PBG), the building block of tetrapyrroles. Condensation of four molecules of PBG by PBG deaminase (Hem3p) results in a linear tetrapyrrole that can be rearranged and cyclized by uroporphyrinogen-III synthase (Hem4p) to yield uroporphyrinogen-III, the major branch point intermediate between heme and siroheme biosynthesis in yeast. The fate of uroporphyrinogen-III is determined by its subsequent modification: decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen-III commits it to the heme biosynthesis pathway, whereas methylation commits it to the biosynthesis of siroheme.

COMMENT - Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules that consist of a glycerol backbone esterified to a phosphate group and two fatty acids. As a primary structural element of biological membranes, phospholipids play important roles in cell morphology and organelle function. The major phospholipids found in total cell extracts from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS); however, the phospholipid composition of yeast changes according to the carbon source used for growth.
/
/All major phospholipid classes in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> may trace their synthesis to a common precursor: cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). CDP-DAG is synthesized in a reaction catalyzed by CDP-DAG synthase, which converts phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-DAG using cytidine triphosphate (CTP) as the CDP donor. There are two distinct CDP-DAG synthases in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: Cds1p, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Tam41p, localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In the ER, CDP-DAG generated by Cds1p can be converted to phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS) via PI synthase (Pis1p) or PS synthase (Cho1p), respectively. In the mitochondrion, CDP-DAG generated by Tam41p can be sequentially converted to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which can be further converted to cardiolipin. Synthesis of PI, PG, and cardiolipin occurs through similar mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, unlike yeast, mammals primarily synthesize PS from other phospholipids and not from CDP-DAG.
/
/PS generated via Pis1p may undergo further processing in the mitochondria, where the enzyme PS decarboxylase (Psd1p) can convert it to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). This represents the major route of PE synthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The second route occurs via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway. This pathway consists of three steps: 1) phosphorylation of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine by ethanolamine kinase (Eki1p) or choline kinase (Cki1p), 2) activation of phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine by phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Ect1p), and 3) transfer of a phosphoethanolamine moiety from CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol by 1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase (Ept1p). The other branch of the Kennedy pathway, the CDP-choline pathway, incorporates choline into phosphatidylcholine (PC) in three analogous steps. PC may also be synthesized from PE when the latter molecule undergoes three successive methylations by Cho2p and Opi3p.

COMMENT - In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the TCA cycle intermediate oxaloacetate can be converted to threonine in six steps. In the first step, oxaloacetate receives an amino group from glutamate via aspartate aminotransferase (Aat1p/Aat2p) to form aspartate. Aspartate is then converted by aspartate kinase (Hom3p) to L-4-aspartyl phosphate, which in turn is sequentially reduced by aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Hom2p) and homoserine dehydrogenase (Hom6p) to form homoserine. Homoserine is subsequently phosphorylated by homoserine kinase (Thr1p) and finally converted to threonine via threonine synthase (Thr4p). Threonine itself, if not utilized for protein synthesis, can be further metabolized to isoleucine or cleaved to produce glycine.
/
/Two intermediates in this pathway represent important crossroads in amino acid metabolism: aspartate and homoserine. Aspartate can be utilized for the synthesis of asparagine, arginine, and homoserine, and homoserine can be utilized for the synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids and threonine. The flow of aspartate and homoserine into threonine biosynthesis appears to be largely modulated by threonine levels: threonine allosterically inhibits aspartate kinase (Hom3p) and competitively inhibits homoserine kinase (Thr1p). Of the two enzyme activities, aspartate kinase activity likely plays a larger role in controlling flux, as yeast strains that possess a Hom3p variant insensitive to feedback inhibition by threonine accumulate over twenty times more threonine than the wild type.
/
/Unlike yeast, mammals lack a threonine biosynthesis pathway and must acquire threonine from the environment. To exploit this difference for medical purposes, efforts have been made to identify potential antifungal agents from compounds that inhibit the enzymes involved in threonine biosynthesis in yeast.

COMMENT - The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a catabolic pathway that functions to generate energy and reduced cofactors from the oxidative decarboxylation of acetyl (C2) units. It occupies a central role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms, enabling the production of energy from carbohydrates, fatty acids, amino acids, and potentially any other molecule that can be converted or broken down to acetyl-CoA. In addition to its role in catabolism, the TCA cycle can also serve a biosynthetic role, as several intermediates in the pathway (e.g. oxaloacetate, succinate) provide carbon for the synthesis of amino acids or other biological compounds.
/
/The glyoxylate cycle is similar to the TCA cycle in that both pathways share the same initial steps, namely the conversion of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to the six-carbon molecule isocitrate. Here the pathways diverge- instead of catalyzing the decarboxylation of isocitrate, the glyoxylate cycle catalyzes the cleavage of isocitrate to the 4-carbon molecule succinate and the 2-carbon molecule glyoxylate. Glyoxylate is then condensed with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form the 4-carbon molecule malate. These two steps are catalyzed by isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, respectively. Malate can then be converted back to oxaloacetate for another round through the pathway. Ultimately, the glyoxylate cycle leads to the net condensation of acetyl units into 4-carbon molecules, whereas the TCA cycle results in the net dissimilation of acetyl carbons as CO2.
/
/The existence of both pathways in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> enables this organism to utilize acetyl units not only for energy (via the TCA cycle), but also for the synthesis of 4-carbon precursors (via the glyoxylate cycle). Consequently, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is able to use C2 carbon sources (e.g. ethanol, acetate) and fatty acids as sole sources of carbon. The key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle- isocitrate lyase and malate synthase- are encoded in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> by ICL1 and MLS1, respectively. Both ICL1 and MLS1 are highly induced by ethanol, acetate, and fatty acids; furthermore, disruption of either gene results in a growth defect on these carbon sources. Whereas the TCA cycle exists in virtually all aerobic organisms, the glyoxylate cycle is unique to plants, fungi, and other microorganisms such as <i>E. coli</i>.

Here, the four-carbon chain of methionine comes from aspartate, which undergoes a three-step conversion to homoserine followed by acetylation to O-acetylhomoserine. The sulfur of methionine is acquired from inorganic sulfate, which is reduced to sulfide via the sulfate assimilation pathway and incorporated into the carbon chain of O-acetyl-L-homoserine to form homocysteine. To synthesize methionine, homocysteine receives a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF) in a reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase (Met6p). 5-methyl-THF is a folate coenzyme that exists in both monoglutamated and polyglutamated forms, however only the latter can be used by Met6p as the methyl donor for this reaction.
/
/In addition to inorganic sulfur, cysteine can also be used as a sulfur source for methionine biosynthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. This occurs through the transsulfuration pathway, where cysteine reacts with O-acetylhomoserine to form cystathionine. Cleavage of cystathionine produces homocysteine, which can undergo conversion to methionine or reverse-transsulfuration to regenerate cysteine. The transsulfuration pathway enables <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to exchange sulfur between methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine.

COMMENT - Many yeast and bacterial species ferment pyruvate to 2,3-butanediol via the intermediate, acetoin.  Although acetoin is a flavorless compound, it is a precursor to some off-odor compounds, such as diacetyl, which can be unfavorable in beer and wine.  Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are both by-products of alcoholic fermentation by S. cerevisiae and other wine yeasts. Acetoin production during alcoholic fermentation depends on the yeast strain and other variables such as substrate and temperature (as reported in |CITS: [16535224]|). Wine yeasts with high fermentation power generally produce low acetoin levels and large amounts of ethanol and higher alcohols (alcohols with more than 2 carbons) (as reported in |CITS: [16535224]|).

COMMENT - Folates are heterocyclic compounds based on a pteroic acid skeleton conjugated to one or more glutamate molecules. The biologically active form of folate is tetrahydrofolate (THF), whose metabolic derivatives serve as cofactors that carry and chemically activate one-carbon (1C) units at different levels of oxidation (methyl-THF, methylene-THF, etc.) The 1C units carried by these folate cofactors are utilized in one-carbon metabolism for the biosynthesis of various compounds including methionine, thymidylate, and purines. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and many other microorganisms are able to synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo, unlike humans who must acquire it from the environment.
/
/In the folate biosynthesis pathway, dihydrofolate synthetase (Fol3p in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>) adds an initial glutamate molecule to the p-aminobenzoic acid moiety of 7,8-dihydropteroate to form 7,8-dihydrofolate. This compound is then reduced by dihydrofolate reductase (Dfr1p) to tetrahydrofolate, which can subsequently be converted to a 1C unit-carrying THF derivative. The folates produced in this pathway are subject to further glutamylation by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (Met7p), which catalyzes ATP-dependent extension of the glutamate side chain to yield folate polyglutamates. Polyglutamylation is thought to increase the affinity of intracellular folates for folate-dependent enzymes and prevent their efflux out of cells and organelles. Lending to the importance of polyglutamylation for folate coenzyme function, fol3 null mutants require folinic acid supplementation for growth and met7 null mutants are respiratory-deficient and auxotrophic for methionine.

COMMENT - In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose is a major reserve carbohydrate that has been shown to stabilize proteins during heat shock and to suppress the aggregation of denatured proteins |CITS:9660948|. Trehalose has also been shown to be important for surviving osmotic, ethanol, and oxidative stresses |CITS:11483159|.  Trehalose biosynthesis also influences glycolysis because trehalose-6-phosphate inhibits hexokinases, which restricts the influx of sugars into glycolysis during a switch to fermentative metabolism |CITS:8809751|. Trehalose biosynthesis is a two step process in which glucose 6-phosphate plus UDP-glucose is converted to alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), and then alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate and water are converted to trehalose and phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) |CITS:11152943|. In S. cerevisiae, both of these steps occur in a single alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase complex which is composed of four protein subunits, Tps1p |CITS:1425702|, Tps2p |CITS:8444170|, Tsl1p |CITS:8404905|, and Tps3p |CITS:9837904|. Tps1p contains the TPS catalytic activity, Tps2p contains the TPP activity, and Tps3p and Tsl1p are regulatory proteins with partially overlapping functions |CITS:9837904|. Deletion of TPS1 results in loss of both TPS activity and trehalose biosynthesis while deletion of TPS2 results in loss of TPP activity. Deletion of either TSL1 or TPS3 result in mild effects, but deletion of both TSL1 and TSL3 results in significant reductions in TPS and TPP activities as well as reduced trehalose biosynthesis |CITS:9837904|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of fatty acid biosynthesis, saturated and unsaturated
COMMENT - Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts |CITS: [Lynen69]|. To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) |CITS: [1350093]|).  Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) |CITS: [7649444]|). 
/
/There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6  |CITS: [17448991]|. Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) |CITS: [365179], [1100391], [10785388], [3528750], [374077]|.
/
/FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 |CITS: [7925441]| and theinositol/choline-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p |CITS: [1461729][7862526]|. The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 |CITS: [11713312]|. The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded |CITS: [1735446][8262967]|.

COMMENT - Thiamin (vitamin B1) is an essential compound for all organisms. The major bioactive form of thiamin, thiamin diphosphate (TDP), is a cofactor for many enzymes involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Bacteria, plants, and fungi are able to synthesize thiamin de novo, while animals must acquire it from the environment. Thiamin is formed from the ring structures of two aromatic compounds: 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine diphosphate (HMP-PP) and 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole phosphate (HET-P). In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, thiamin diphosphate is synthesized from HMP-PP and HET-P in three steps. First, HMP-PP and HET-P are condensed by Thi6p to yield thiamin monophosphate (TMP). Second, TMP is dephosphorylated to yield thiamine. This step is presumed to be catalyzed by nonspecific phosphatases in the cytosol. Third, thiamine is pyrophosphorylated by thiamin pyrophosphokinase (Thi80p) to yield TDP.
/
/The thiazole and pyrimidine heterocycles of thiamin are derived from HET-P and HMP-PP, respectively. The underlying mechanisms for the synthesis of the thiazole and pyrimidine precursors in yeast are not yet fully understood. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the thiazole is formed from NAD, glycine, and a cysteine residue from the active site of thiazole synthase (Thi4p). This unusual suicide mechanism results in a single turnover capacity for Thi4p. Likewise, the pyrimidine ring is formed from histidine and pyridoxal phosphate via the action of THI5 family enzymes, and may also involve a suicide mechanism where histidine is supplied from the active site of Thi5p. The single turnover capacity of Thi4p and Thi5p is speculated to balance the provision of thiazole and pyramidine heterocycles and provide an alternate regulatory mechanism for thiamin biosynthesis in yeast (see |CITS: [23048037]|).

COMMENT - Chitosan, a beta-1,4 -D-glucosamine homopolymer, is a component of the yeast spore wall (ascospore) 
/and is produced by the deacetylation of nascent chains of chitin, a beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D- glucosamine 
/homopolymer.  The CDA1 and CDA2 genes, expressed specifically during sporulation, account for the 
/total chitin deacetylase activity in S. cerevisiae (|CITS:[8940152]|).

COMMENT - Chitin, a linear polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues joined by beta-(1,4) linkages, is a 
/minor but essential structural component of fungal cell walls.  The majority (90%) of chitin in the cell wall 
/is synthesized by chitin synthase III (CSIII), one of the three chitin synthases in S. cerevisiae 
/(as reviewed in |CITS:[8257107]|).  Each of the three chitin synthases (CSI, CSII, and CSIII) are 
/nonessential, but the lack of all three leads to cell lethality (|CITS:[2050738]|). The genes encoding the 
/catalytic subunits of CSI, CSII, and CSIII are CHS1, CHS2, and CHS3, respectively.  
/Skt5p (Chs4/Cal2/Csd4) has been shown to physically interact with 
/Chs3p, and is indispensable for its 
/enzymatic activity in vivo (|CITS:[ 17142567]|). Chitin is deacetylated to form chitosan, a component of 
/the yeast spore wall (ascospore).

COMMON-NAME - NAD salvage pathway IV (from nicotinamide riboside)
CITATIONS - 15137942
COMMENT - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for cellular redox reactions and energy 
/metabolism.  NAD also has been shown to be an important substrate in a variety of biological processes, 
/including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling pathways, 
/calorie-restriction-mediated life-span extension and age-associated diseases 
/|CITS: [12736687],[12648681]|. NAD appears to affect these processes by regulating the Sir2p family of 
/NAD-dependent deacetylases (Sirtuins) |CITS: [12648681]|. 
/
/There are a number of pathways for NAD biosynthesis.  In yeast and most other organisms, the two major 
/pathways are de novo synthesis of NAD (the de novo pathway) and regeneration of NAD from its 
/nicotinamide degradation products (the NAD salvage pathway) |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. NAD is 
/synthesized de novo from tryptophan via kynurenine |CITS: [12972620]|. In this pathway tryptophan is 
/converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in 6 enzymatic steps (catalyzed by Bna1-2p, and 
/Bna4-7p) and one non-enzymatic step |CITS: [12972620]|. At NAMN the de novo pathway converges with 
/the NAD salvage pathway and the last two steps to NAD are shared |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. In 
/the yeast NAD salvage pathway, the vitamin precursors nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are converted to 
/NAMN, the point of convergence with the de novo pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.  The steps from nicotinic 
/acid to NAD were elucidated by Preiss and Handler and are sometimes referred to as the Preiss-Handler 
/pathway |CITS: [13416279], [13563526]|. Yeast can also import extracellular nicotinic acid into the cell by 
/the permease Tna1p and then convert it into NAD via the Preiss-Handler pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.
/
/There are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin 
/precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) 
/|CITS: [15137942], [17482543], [17914902]|. Three of these salvage pathways converge first with the NAD 
/salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway, while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is 
/independent of both of these pathways. In the NR salvage pathway I, NR is phosphorylated to 
/nicotinamide mononucleotide by the kinase Nrk1p, and then adenylated to NAD by Nma1p or Nma2p 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza that lack the enzymes of the de novo and 
/Preiss-Handler pathway can synthesize NAD from NR and nicotinamide mononucleotide as well 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Humans also appear to have this NR salvage pathway |CITS: [15137942]|. Yeast have 
/a second NR salvage pathway (NR salvage pathway II) that is independent of Nrk1p; in NR salvage 
/pathway II NR is split into a ribosyl product and nicotinamide, which is subsequently converted to NAD 
/via enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway and de novo pathway |CITS: [17482543]|. The initial steps in 
/the two NaR salvage pathways are similar to those of the NR salvage pathways and are catalyzed by the 
/same enzymes; Nrk1p catalyzes the first step in the NR and NaR salvage pathways I and Urh1p and 
/Pnp1p catalyze the first steps of the NR and NaR salvage pathways II |CITS: [17914902]|.

COMMENT - Cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) is a liponucleotide and the precursor to all major phospholipids in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. It is synthesized in a reaction catalyzed by CDP-DAG synthase, which converts phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-DAG using cytidine triphosphate (CTP) as the CDP donor. There are two distinct CDP-DAG synthases in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: Cds1p, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Tam41p, localized in the mitochondrial matrix. Both localizations represent the site of action for the CDP-DAG pathway of phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast. At the ER site, CDP-DAG generated by Cds1p can be converted to phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS) via PI synthase (Pis1p) and PS synthase (Cho1p), respectively. At the mitochondrial site, CDP-DAG generated by Tam41p can be sequentially converted to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and further converted to cardiolipin. Synthesis of PI, PG, and cardiolipin occurs through similar mechanisms in mammalian cells; however, unlike yeast, mammals primarily synthesize PS from other phospholipids and not from CDP-DAG.

COMMENT - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for cellular redox reactions and energy 
/metabolism.  NAD also has been shown to be an important substrate in a variety of biological processes, 
/including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling pathways, 
/calorie-restriction-mediated life-span extension and age-associated diseases 
/|CITS: [12736687],[12648681]|. NAD appears to affect these processes by regulating the Sir2p family of 
/NAD-dependent deacetylases (Sirtuins) |CITS: [12648681]|. 
/
/There are a number of pathways for NAD biosynthesis.  In yeast and most other organisms, the two major 
/pathways are de novo synthesis of NAD (the de novo pathway) and regeneration of NAD from its 
/nicotinamide degradation products (the NAD salvage pathway) |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. NAD is 
/synthesized de novo from tryptophan via kynurenine |CITS: [12972620]|. In this pathway tryptophan is 
/converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in 6 enzymatic steps (catalyzed by Bna1-2p, and 
/Bna4-7p) and one non-enzymatic step |CITS: [12972620]|. At NAMN the de novo pathway converges with 
/the NAD salvage pathway and the last two steps to NAD are shared |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. In 
/the yeast NAD salvage pathway, the vitamin precursors nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are converted to 
/NAMN, the point of convergence with the de novo pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.  The steps from nicotinic 
/acid to NAD were elucidated by Preiss and Handler and are sometimes referred to as the Preiss-Handler 
/pathway |CITS: [13416279], [13563526]|. Yeast can also import extracellular nicotinic acid into the cell by 
/the permease Tna1p and then convert it into NAD via the Preiss-Handler pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.
/
/There are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin 
/precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) 
/|CITS: [15137942], [17482543], [17914902]|. Three of these salvage pathways converge first with the NAD 
/salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway, while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is 
/independent of both of these pathways. In the NR salvage pathway I, NR is phosphorylated to 
/nicotinamide mononucleotide by the kinase Nrk1p, and then adenylated to NAD by Nma1p or Nma2p 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza that lack the enzymes of the de novo and 
/Preiss-Handler pathway can synthesize NAD from NR and nicotinamide mononucleotide as well 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Humans also appear to have this NR salvage pathway |CITS: [15137942]|. Yeast have 
/a second NR salvage pathway (NR salvage pathway II) that is independent of Nrk1p; in NR salvage 
/pathway II NR is split into a ribosyl product and nicotinamide, which is subsequently converted to NAD 
/via enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway and de novo pathway |CITS: [17482543]|. The initial steps in 
/the two NaR salvage pathways are similar to those of the NR salvage pathways and are catalyzed by the 
/same enzymes; Nrk1p catalyzes the first step in the NR and NaR salvage pathways I and Urh1p and 
/Pnp1p catalyze the first steps of the NR and NaR salvage pathways II |CITS: [17914902]|.

COMMENT - There are several pathways for serine and glycine biosynthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. When glucose is used as the carbon source, glycine can be synthesized from threonine via threonine aldolase (Gly1p) in the threonine pathway, while serine can be synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate in the phosphoglycerate pathway. Expression of the genes involved in the latter pathway decreases upon depletion of glucose. When ethanol or other non-fermentable substrates are used as the carbon source, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> can alternatively synthesize glycine from glyoxylate via alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (Agx1p). Glycine and serine produced in these pathways can be interconverted to one another via the tetrahydrofolate-dependent serine hydroxymethyltransferases Shm1p and Shm2p. Between these, the cytoplasmic isoform Shm2p serves as the major source of glycine (via serine breakdown) in serine-rich conditions. The mitochondrial isoform Shm1p may also contribute to glycine synthesis, however it preferentially catalyzes serine synthesis from glycine under conditions of serine starvation.

COMMENT - Sulfite and nitrite reductases catalyze the six-electron reduction of sulphite to sulfide and nitrite to
/ ammonia, respectively, which are key enzymatic steps
/in the assimilation of sulfur and nitrogen into all life forms |CITS: [8994874]|. Siroheme, a modified cyclic tetrapyrrole, similar in structure to heme, chlorophyll and cobalamin, is used as a prosthetic group by sulfite and nitrite reductases |CITS: [4583265]|.  Similar to many cyclic tetrapyrroles, siroheme coordinates with a metal in its central cavity. While siroheme and heme coordinate an iron atom, chlorophyll and cobalamin coordinate maganesium and cobalt, respectively.
/
/Assimilatory sulfite reductases are found in bacteria, plants and fungi, but not in animals, while dissimilatory sulfite reductases are found in diverse sulfate-reducing eubacteria and some species of thermophilic archaebacteria |CITS: [8994874]|.  Assimilatory nitrite reductases are also found in bacteria, plants, and fungi |CITS: [8994874]|, but not in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Thus, in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> siroheme is used exclusively in sulfite reductase.
/
/The biologically important modified tetrapyrroles, such as siroheme, heme, chlorophyll and cobalamin share a common biosynthetic pathway up to the synthesis of the first macrocyclic intermediate uroporphyrinogen-III |CITS: [2077690]|.  Siroheme is biosynthesized from uroporphyringoen-III in four enzymatic steps:  two transmethylations, a dehydrogenation, and a ferrochelation |CITS: [10051442]|. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i> the two transmethylations are catalyzed by Met1p, a uroporphyrin III methyltransferase that requires S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor, and the dehydrogenation and ferrochelation reactions are catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme Met8p |CITS: [10051442], [9003798], [11980703]|. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> K12 a single trifunctional enzyme,  siroheme synthase (CysG), catalyzes all four siroheme biosynthetic reactions |CITS: [7945210]|.

COMMENT - Tetrapyrroles are a group of molecules that contain of four pyrrole rings linked together by single-atom bridges in a cyclic or linear arrangement. Biologically important cyclic tetrapyrroles, such as chlorophyll, cobalamin, heme, and siroheme, coordinate a metal ion in their central cavity and function as cofactors in numerous biological processes. Heme, which coordinates an iron atom, functions in oxygen sensing and utilization.
/
/To synthesize heme and other tetrapyrrole-derived compounds, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> utilizes a common biosynthetic pathway that leads up to the formation of the first macrocyclic intermediate, uroporphyrinogen-III, upon which the pathways diverge. In the heme biosynthetic route, four carboxyl groups are removed sequentially from the acetate side chains of uroporphyrinogen-III by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Hem12p) to form coproporphyrinogen III. Decarboxylation of two of the carboxyethyl side chains of coproporphyrinogen III by coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (Hem13p) then forms protoporphyrinogen IX, which is subsequently oxidized by protoporphyrinogen oxidase (Hem14p) to yield protoporphyrin IX. In the final step, a ferrous ion is inserted into protoporphyrin IX by ferrochelatase (Hem15p), forming the end-product heme.

COMMENT - UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is a sugar nucleotide utilized for the biosynthesis of chitin, a major structural polysaccharide in the yeast cell wall. UDP-GlcNAc also provides GlcNAc moieties for N-linked glycosylation of proteins and for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a lipid anchor involved in tethering proteins to the cell membrane. Synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc is an essential process in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>; conditional depletion of several of the enzymes in the pathway (Gna1p, Pcm1p, Qri1p) results in aberrant cell morphology and increased cell lysis.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized in four steps from fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). First, F6P is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) by glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). Second, GlcN6P is N-acetylated by GlcN6P acetyltransferase (Gna1p). This forms GlcNAc-6-P, which in the third step of the pathway is isomerized to GlcNAc-1-P by phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (Pcm1p). Finally, GlcNAc-1-P is condensed with UTP via UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (Qri1p), yielding UDP-GlcNAc. The UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis pathway described in yeast occurs similarly in other eukaryotes, however in the bacterial pathway GlcN-6-P is initially isomerized to GlcN-1-P prior to N-acetylation.

COMMENT - Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are the monomeric building blocks of DNA. In all cellular organisms, synthesis of the four canonical dNTPs (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP) required for DNA replication and repair involves the action of ribonucleotide reductase, which converts ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxy- forms by substituting their 2-hydroxyl group with a hydrogen atom. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> contains a class Ia RNR that is composed of two large and two small subunits. RNR2 and RNR4 encode the small subunits, while the large subunits are encoded by either RNR1 (major isoform) or RNR3 (minor isoform). Budding yeast RNR accepts ribonucleoside diphosphates (e.g. ADP, UDP) as substrate and converts them to their corresponding deoxy- forms (e.g. dADP, dUDP). These dNDPs can then be phosphorylated by NDP kinase (Ynk1p) to yield dNTPs. In contrast to the class I RNRs in yeast and other eukaryotes, class II and class III RNRs found in archaea and many bacteria can produce dNTPs directly by using NTPs as substrates.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the only dNDP that cannot be synthesized directly by RNR is dTDP. Synthesis of thymine-containing nucleotides requires dUMP, which can be formed via the removal of pyrophosphate from dUTP by dUTP pyrophosphatase (Dut1p). dTMP is synthesized from dUMP when the latter molecule receives a methyl group from 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate via thymidylate synthase (Cdc21p). The subsequent phosphorylation of dTMP by thymidylate kinase (Cdc8p) yields dTDP, which can be phosphorylated once more by Ynk1p to yield the end product dTTP.

COMMENT - The deoxynucleotides required for DNA synthesis can either be made de novo, or they can be salvaged from endogenous degradation processes |CITS: 10501935||CITS: 2189783|. If the required substrates are available, the salvage pathways of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides are preferred over de novo synthesis pathways for pyrimidine biosynthesis |CITS:12111094|. As with many of the metabolic pathways of S. cerevisiae, the pathways for the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides are regulated by a variety of processes, including transcription regulation |CITS: 11292850||CITS: 12570998|.
/
/Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three enzymes (Urk1p, Urh1p, and Cdd1p) that are able to salvage deoxycytidine in vitro |CITS: 12111094|. However of these three enzymes, only Urk1p and Urh1p have been shown to metabolize deoxycytidine in vivo |CITS: 12111094|. In vitro Cdd1p has been shown to deaminate deoxycytidine to form deoxyuridine, however the biological significance of this is doubtful |CITS:10501935||CITS:12111094|. Evidence that Cdd1p is not important for deoxypyrimidine salvage comes from the observation that fyc1 urh1 urk1 triple mutants are resistant to 5-fluorodeoxycytidine, indicating that these cells are not able to metabolize deoxycytidine |CITS:12111094|. Also deoxyuridine does not allow growth of ura- strains, indicating that deoxyuridine cannot be utilized as a sole source of pyrimidines in S. cerevisiae |CITS:12111094|.

COMMENT - Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides serve many diverse and essential roles in the cell. They are precursors to DNA, RNA, and many important metabolites (e.g. CDP-diacylglycerol). In addition, nucleotides can be used as an energy source (primarily as ATP), signaling molecules, and cofactor components (e.g. coenzyme A).
/
/De novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis in yeast involves the 10-step production of the purine nucleotide inosine monophosphate (IMP), the common precursor to both adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Synthesis of IMP begins with a reaction catalyzed by amidophosphoribosyltransferase (Ade4p) between PRPP (5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate), glutamine, and water. Glutamine displaces the pyrophosphate group of PRPP, converting PRPP to phosphoribosylamine. The amino group of phosphoribosylamine subsequently reacts with a carboxyl group of glycine via Ade5,7p, forming the amide bond of phosphoribosylglycinamide. In the third reaction of the pathway, a tetrahydrofolate cofactor donates a one-carbon unit at the oxidation level of formate to the -amino group of phosphoribosylglycinamide. This forms phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide, which reacts with an amino group from glutamine via Ade6p to form phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine. In three ATP-dependent steps, this product then undergoes closure of the imidazole ring by Ade5,7p, carboxylation by Ade2p, and condensation with aspartate by Ade1p. Adenylosuccinate lyase (Ade13p) subsequently catalyzes cleavage with release of fumarate to form aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In the final two steps, Ade16p or Ade17p introduce a formyl group to the amino group on the imidazole ring, then condense the formyl carbon with the nitrogen from the amide group. This results in closure of the 6-membered ring and yields the purine nucleotide IMP.
/
/The incorporation of an aspartate group to IMP, followed by cleavage with the loss of fumarate, results in the conversion IMP to AMP. These reactions are catalyzed by adenylosuccinate synthetase (Ade12p) and adenylosuccinate lyase (Ade13p), respectively. Oxidation of IMP, on the other hand, converts it to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP). XMP can be amidated (using glutamine as the donor) to form GMP in a reaction catalyzed by GMP synthase (Gua1p).

COMMENT - Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides serve many diverse and essential roles in the cell. They are precursors to DNA, RNA, and many important metabolites (e.g. CDP-diacylglycerol). In addition, nucleotides can be used as an energy source (primarily as ATP), signaling molecules, and cofactor components (e.g. coenzyme A).
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the initial steps of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed by the bifunctional carbamoylphosphate synthetase/aspartate transcarbamylase Ura2p. In the first step, Ura2p catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoylphosphate from CO2, ATP, and glutamine. In the second, Ura2p condenses carbamoylphosphate with aspartate to yield ureidosuccinate/carbamoyl-L-aspartate. Third, dihydroorotase (Ura4p) catalyzes closure of the pyrimidine ring of ureidosuccinate to form dihydroorotate (DHO). DHO, in turn, is oxidized to orotic acid (OA), condensed with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate to form orotidine 5-monophosphate, and finally decarboxylated to yield UMP. These three steps are catalyzed by Ura1p, Ura5p/Ura10p, and Ura3p, respectively. UMP may then undergo further processing to form other pyrimidines.
/
/The de novo pyrimidine pathway is regulated at both the enzymatic and transcriptional levels. Ura2p, which catalyzes the first committed step of the pathway, is subject to end product feedback inhibition by UTP. Transcription of URA2 is repressed by UTP and uracil. Furthermore, transcription of URA2 and several other genes in the pathway is upregulated in response to pyrimidine starvation. Upregulation of URA1, URA3, and URA4 during pyrimidine starvation depends upon the zinc finger transcription factor Ppr1p. Two intermediates in the pyrimidine pathway regulate the transcriptional activity of Ppr1p: DHO and OA. At low concentrations, these intermediates convert Ppr1p into its active state, resulting in transcription of URA genes. High concentrations of DHO and OA, however, inhibit Ppr1p activity in vitro.

COMMENT - Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential as components of nucleic acids, as substrates for amino acid synthesis and as energy sources, but defects in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines are not lethal in S. cerevisiae cells 
/|CITS:10501935|.  This is because salvage pathways are able to utilize preformed bases (either from exogenous sources or internal turnover sources) for the synthesis of pyrimidines |CITS:2189783|. If the required substrates are available, salvage pathways are preferred over de novo synthesis pathways for pyrimidine biosynthesis |CITS:12111094|.
/
/The salvage pathways of pyrimidine ribonucleotides consist of 1) importing exogenous bases into the cell, and 2) the interconversion of various bases |CITS:2189783||CITS:12111094|. Three proteins are involved in the import of exogenous bases used by the salvage pathway for pyrimidine ribonucleotide biosynthesis. Uracil enters the cell via the Fur4p uracil permease |CITS:6290876||CITS:3276521|, cytosine enters the cell via the Fcy2p purine-cytosine transporter |CITS:6387700||CITS:2191181|, and uridine enters the cell via the Fui1p uridine permease |CITS:9485596|.  As with many of the metabolic pathways of S. cerevisiae, the pathways for the salvage of pyrimidine ribonucleotides are under both transcriptional and post-transcriptional catabolite repression at a variety of points 
/|CITS:10074071||CITS:11125145||CITS:12111094||CITS:12570998||CITS:12791685||CITS:1429716||CITS:14657252|.
/
/This pathway is of biomedical interest because cytosine deaminase (Fcy1p) is not found in mammals |CITS:12637534| and is capable of catalyzing the deamination of the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) to form the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU) |CITS:15823054|. Expression of Fcy1p in tumor cells increases their sensitivity to 5FC, and expression of Fur1p increases tumor cell sensitivity to 5FU |CITS:10919655|. Tumor cells expressing a novel chimeric protein, produced from a gene containing the FCY1 and FUR1 coding sequences fused in frame, display significantly increased sensitivity to 5-FC suggesting that this novel suicide gene may constitute an original and potent candidate therapeutic gene for cancer gene therapy |CITS:10919655|.

COMMENT - In yeast and most eukaryotes, purine nucleotides levels are maintained via a combination of de novo synthesis and salvage pathways. The salvage pathways utilize purine bases and nucleosides taken up from the environment or formed from metabolism to synthesize purine nucleoside monophosphates. Compared to the de novo pathway, where 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is converted to the adenylic/guanylic nucleotide precursor inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP) over many ATP-consuming steps, the salvage pathways synthesize IMP, GMP, and AMP directly from PRPP and a purine base via the action of purine phosphoribosyltransferases. There are three main phosphoribosyltransferases involved in purine salvage in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: i) Hpt1p, which produces GMP and IMP from guanine and hypoxanthine, respectively; ii) Apt1p, which synthesizes AMP from adenine; and iii) Xpt1p, which synthesizes XMP from xanthine. XMP can be further converted to GMP via the GMP synthase Gua1p. The salvage pathways represent the preferred route of synthesis when purines are abundant in the growth medium. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, most of the ADE genes responsible for de novo synthesis of IMP and AMP are repressed by extracellular adenine, whereas extracellular guanine strongly represses the IMD genes responsible for the rate-limiting step of GMP synthesis.

COMMENT - Purine bases (guanine, adenine, etc.) acquired from the environment or formed as a product of nucleic acid degradation can be recycled for purine nucleotide synthesis via purine salvage pathways. In the salvage pathway for guanine, guanine is converted to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Alternatively, guanine can be converted to xanthine by guanine deaminase. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, these enzymes are encoded by HPT1 and GUD1, respectively. Xanthine itself can be salvaged to form XMP by xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Xpt1p in yeast) and further converted to GMP by GMP synthase (Gua1p). <i>S. cerevisiae</i> mutants defective in the de novo GMP biosynthesis pathway are viable when supplied with guanine, demonstrating that the salvage pathway can act as a sufficient source of guanylic nucleotides in this organism.
/
/Because overproduction or starvation of purine nucleotides is deleterious to cells, the intracellular pool of these compounds must be carefully balanced. Purine salvage appears to be an important factor in this regard. Deletion of HPT1 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> leads to de-repression of enzymes involved in the de novo pathway, resulting in constitutively active purine nucleotide biosynthesis. On the other hand, overexpression of feedback-insensitive mutant hpt1 in the presence of guanine leads to guanylic nucleotide overaccumulation and massive cell death. Notably, deficiency of HPRT activity in humans results in increased production of purine nucleotides and is also regarded as the cause of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

COMMENT - Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  One branch proceeds to phenylalanine and tyrosine, and the other to tryptophan |CITS:[Jones]|. The phenylalanine and tyrosine branch has one reaction in common, rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate, at which point, the pathway branches again to either phenylalanine or tyrosine |CITS:[1943992]|). S. cerevisiae, similar to E. coli, synthesize phenylalanine and tyrosine via the intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, respectively, while some other organisms synthesize them via arogenate |CITS:[1943992]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The carbon flow through the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal end-products. The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two isoenzymes Aro3p or Aro4p, whereby Aro3p is inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p by tyrosine |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes; however, no GCN4 regulation was found for ARO7 of the phenylalanine and tyrosine and branch, TYR1 of the tyrosine branch, or TRP1 of the tryptophan branch |CITS:[1943992]|.

COMMENT - Alanine is an essential component of protein (as L-alpha-alanine).  
/
/alt1 null mutations demonstrated that under respiratory conditions, the alanine aminotransferase encoded by ALT1 plays a central role in arginine biosynthesis and degradation in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [19396236]|.  Under fermentative conditions, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>  appears to synthesize alanine by an alternative pathway that is independent of Alt1p, but it degrades alanine by the same Alt1p-dependent pathway as used during respiration |CITS: [19396236]|.

COMMENT - Serine is a proteinogenic amino acid and a precursor to the amino acids tryptophan, glycine, and cysteine. Serine is also the primary source of one-carbon units in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, a network of carbon transfer reactions required for the biosynthesis of methionine, thymidylate, and purines. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> possesses three major pathways for serine biosynthesis: a phosphoglycerate pathway that synthesizes serine from 3-phosphoglycerate, a threonine pathway that synthesizes serine from threonine-derived glycine, and a glyoxylate pathway that synthesizes serine from glyoxylate-derived glycine. The former two pathways operate when glucose is the carbon source while the latter pathway operates during growth on non-fermentable substrates.
/
/In the glyoxylate pathway, glyoxylate is converted to glycine via alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (Agx1p). Glycine is then converted to serine via serine hydroxymethyltransferase (Shm1p/Shm2p). The reaction catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase is reversible; however the cytoplasmic isoform (SHM2) is thought to contribute more to serine catabolism while the mitochondrial isoform (SHM1) contributes to serine synthesis. The roles of SHM1 and SHM2 are reported to change in accordance to the nutritional requirements of the cell, particularly to the availability of serine or glycine. Despite the proposed preference of Shm2p for glycine synthesis, expression of SHM2 but not SHM1 is increased in the presence of glycine.

COMMENT - The biosynthesis of aspartate is an interface between amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. Aspartate is synthesized through a transamination reaction between oxaloacetate, an important Krebs cycle intermediate, and glutamate, an amino acid. Here, aspartate aminotransferase catalyzes the reversible transfer of an amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate, forming -ketoglutarate and aspartate. Yeast aspartate aminotransferase is encoded by AAT1 and AAT2. Aat1p localizes to mitochondria and may be involved in a putative malate-aspartate shuttle, while Aat2p localizes to the cytosol and is required for growth on minimal media lacking aspartate. Aspartate, in addition to its role as a proteinogenic amino acid, is a substrate in the arginine biosynthesis pathway and a precursor to the aspartate family amino acids methionine, isoleucine, asparagine, and threonine in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.

COMMENT - Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  One branch proceeds to tryptophan, and the other to tyrosine and phenylalanine |CITS:[Jones]|.  The series of reactions to chorismate, called the shikimate pathway, and the series of reactions from chorismate to tryptophan have been found to be common to all eukaryotes and prokaryotes studied thus far (as reported in |CITS:[1943992]|). In contrast, there appears to be two separate routes from chorismate to tyrosine and phenylalanine, only one of which has been found in S. cerevisiae |CITS:[1943992]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan, and the first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes; however, no GCN4 regulation was found for TRP1 of the tryptophan branch, TYR1 of the tyrosine branch or ARO7 of the tyrosine and phenylalanine branch |CITS:[1943992]|.

COMMENT - Many organisms possess sulfur salvage pathways that enable recovery of the reduced sulfur atom in metabolites of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) after AdoMet is consumed in a metabolic reaction. The methionine salvage pathway, also known as the 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) cycle, is one such example. The MTA cycle regenerates methionine from the AdoMet metabolite 5-methylthioadenosine/MTA, which is formed predominantly as a byproduct of polyamine biosynthesis. The methionine salvage pathway is present in all types of organisms, and may have evolved to reuse sulfur after its costly assimilation into the cell.
/ 
/In the MTA cycle, four carbon atoms from the ribose moiety (C-2 through C-5) of MTA give rise to the carbon skeleton of methionine while the methylthiol group is conserved. The preferred amino group donor for the transamination reaction at the final step of pathway varies by organism; in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, branched-chain and aromatic amino acids are both preferred donors. This step occurs via the branched-chain transaminases Bat1p and Bat2p or the aromatic amino acid transaminases Aro8p and Aro9p. The less-used donors for this reaction in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are lysine, proline, glutamate, and glutamine. In addition to methionine, the MTA cycle may also serve as a source of purines, as adenine is cleaved off from MTA during the first reaction of the cycle.

COMMENT - <i>S. cerevisiae</i> synthesizes methionine via the methylation of homocysteine. In this reaction, the cobalamin-independent methionine synthase Met6p catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF) to the thiol of homocysteine, forming methionine. 5-methyl-THF is a folate coenzyme that carries a single-carbon unit originating from one-carbon metabolism. It exists in both monoglutamated and polyglutamated forms, however only the latter can be used by Met6p as the methyl donor for this reaction. Yeast cells defective in polyglutamylation of folate coenzymes (MET7 null mutants) are auxotrophic for methionine. 
/
/The other component of this reaction, homocysteine, is derived from aspartate and sulfur. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, aspartate can be utilized for homocysteine biosynthesis by undergoing a three-step conversion to homoserine followed by acetylation to O-acetylhomoserine. O-acetylhomoserine can then react with sulfide to produce homocysteine directly, or it can react with cysteine (a sulfur amino acid) to produce cystathionine via the transsulfuration pathway. The subsequent cleavage of cystathionine produces homocysteine.

COMMENT - While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support growth |CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]|.  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen |CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]|. S. cerevisiae degrade the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) and the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and iso-leucine) via the Ehrlich pathway |CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]|.  This pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil |CITS:[10989420][Large 86]|.

/Aro10p appears to be the primary decarboxylase catalyzing the second step in phenylalanine degradation |CITS:[12902239][15933030]|.   Although Vulrahan et. al. (2003) |CITS:[12902239]| found that THI3 does not encode an active phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, they found Thi3p was required in conjunction with one of the pyruvate decarboxylases  Pdc1p, Pdc5p or Pdc6p for the ARO10-independent decarboxylase activity.   The main uptake systems for utilizing aromatic amino acids appear to be Gap1p, a general amino acid permease, and Wap1p, an inducible amino acid permease with wide substrate specificity |CITS:[10207060]|

COMMENT - Threonine degradation can occur via several routes in the budding yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. In the first route, threonine is deaminated to produce ammonia and -ketobutyrate. This reaction is catalyzed by the so-called ""catabolic threonine (and serine) deaminase Cha1p or the biosynthetic threonine deaminase Ilv1p. Cha1p enables <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to produce ammonia from the catabolism of serine or threonine, consequently enabling the use of either amino acid as a sole source of nitrogen. In contrast, Ilv1p is thought to serve a mainly biosynthetic role by degrading threonine to -ketobutyrate, the initial substrate for isoleucine biosynthesis. CHA1 is transcriptionally induced by serine and threonine, whereas ILV1 is regulated by general control of amino acid biosynthesis. 
/
/The second route of threonine degradation occurs via threonine aldolase, encoded by GLY1 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Threonine aldolase directly cleaves threonine to form glycine and acetaldehyde. Disruption of GLY1 leads to strongly reduced growth in minimal media lacking glycine, suggesting that threonine catabolism via threonine aldolase is the major source of glycine in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.
/
/The third, putative route of threonine degradation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is the NAD-dependent oxidation of threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate. In many organisms, this reaction is catalyzed by threonine dehydrogenase (TDH). The existence of this enzyme in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is uncertain, however low levels of TDH activity have been reported in one study (see Murata et al., 1986). <i>S. cerevisiae</i> also lacks 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase (KBL), the enzyme responsible for converting the product of TDH (2-amino-3-oxobutanoate) to glycine. Because 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate is unstable, the fate of this product in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is presumed to be spontaneous decarboxylation to aminoacetate.

COMMENT - Yeast cells contain 3 pathways for the synthesis of glutamate.  Two pathways are mediated by two isoforms of glutamate dehydrogenase, encoded by GDH1 and GDH3 |CITS: [2989290]||CITS: [9287019]|.  The third pathway is driven by the combined activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, encoded by GLN1 and GLT1, respectively |CITS: [2570348]||CITS: [8923741]|.  Gln1p catalyzes amination of glutamate to form glutamine; Glt1p then transfers the amide group of glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate, generating two molecules of glutamate.  Glutamate synthase, also referred to as GOGAT, is a trimer of three Glt1p subunits.  Expression of the GLT1 gene is modulated by glutamate-mediated repression and by Gln3p/Gcn4p-mediated activation, depending upon the availability of nitrogen and glutamate in the medium.  In amino acid starvation conditions, GLT1 expression is activated to a moderate degree by Gcn4p |CITS: [9657994]|.

COMMENT - Yeast cells contain 3 pathways for the synthesis of glutamate.  Two pathways are mediated by two isoforms of glutamate dehydrogenase, encoded by GDH1 and GDH3 |CITS: [2989290]||CITS: [9287019]|.  The third pathway is driven by the combined activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, encoded by GLN1 and GLT1, respectively |CITS: [2570348]||CITS: [8923741]|.  Studies of GDH1 and GDH3 regulation indicate that the cell uses these isoforms under different growth conditions |CITS: [11562373]|.  Expression of GDH3 is induced by ethanol and repressed by glucose, whereas GDH1 expression is high in either carbon source.  Gdh1p uses alpha-ketoglutarate at a higher rate than Gdh3p.  Thus, under fermentative growth conditions, Gdh1p drives glutamate biosynthesis, whereas in nonfermentable or limiting carbon sources, Gdh3p is the key isoform involved in balancing distribution of alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate biosynthesis and energy metabolism.

COMMENT - S. cerevisiae synthesizes the essential amino acid L-lysine via the L-alpha-aminoadipic acid
/pathway instead of the diaminopmelate pathway |CITS: [10714900]|.  Originally proposed to be characteristic of fungi,
/recent studies suggest prokaryotes also synthesize lysine via the alpha-aminoadipic acid pathway |CITS: [11029074]|.
/Intermediates in this pathway are often incorporated into secondary metabolites.  For example, it has been well-
/studied that alpha-aminoadipate is required for penicillin production |CITS: [10714900]|.  
/
/Regulation of the lysine biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae is an interaction between general amino acid
/control (via Gcn4p) |CITS: [Hinnebusch]|, feedback inhibition of homocitrate synthase activity by lysine |CITS: [10103047]|, and induction of
/Lys14p by alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde |CITS: [10975256]|.

COMMENT - While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support growth |CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]|.  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen |CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]|. S. cerevisiae degrade the aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) and branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and iso-leucine) via the Ehrlich pathway |CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]|.  This pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil |CITS:[10989420][Large 86]|.  Fusel alcohols are important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented food products and beverages (as reported in |CITS:[9546164]|.
/
/Both the constitutive aromatic aminotransferase I (ARO8p) and the inducible aromatic aminotransferase II (ARO9p) can catalyze the initial reaction in tyrosine degradation |CITS:[ 6763508]|.  In vitro studies demonstrated that Aro9p is active with phenylpyruvate, pyruvate, or p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, but not 2-oxoglutarate as the amino acceptor, while Aro8p is active with phenylpyruvate, pyruvate, or 2-oxoglutarate |CITS:[6763508]|.  Aro9p is induced by aromatic amino acids and is subject to nitrogen regulation |CITS:[6763508][10207060]|.

CITATIONS - 12620851
COMMENT - Under conditions where optimal sources of nitrogen are unavailable, S. cerevisiae is able to utilize arginine as its sole nitrogen source. 
/Arginine catabolism occurs in the cytosol with the hydrolysis of arginine to proline, releasing three nitrogen
/atoms that can be used by the cell |CITS: [14263163]|, |CITS: [1592829]|. In the absence of oxygen, the proline ring
/is unable to be further degraded |CITS: [1592829]|. The utilization of arginine as a nitrogen source is repressed if 
/better nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, asparagine or glutamine are present. This is known as nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)
/|CITS: [10640599]|. The CAR1 gene is subject to the effect of this repression which is mediated by the negative regulator Ure2p |CITS: [8622686]|, |CITS: [7891726]|.
/In the presence of arginine and the absence of a preferred nitrogen source, NCR is released by the GATA transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p |CITS:[7568152]|, |CITS: [8816501]|, |CITS: [12796300]|.  Unrelated to NCR, the presence of arginine also induces CAR1 and CAR2 expression by the regulators
/Arg80p, Arg81p and Mcm1p |CITS:[9065690]|, |CITS: [11119723]|.
/The CAR genes are also activated by the globally acting transcription factors Rap1p and Abf1p |CITS: [10559172]|, |CITS: [8816501]|. Conversely, CAR1 and CAR2 experssion is repressed by the Ume6p-Sin2p-Rpd3p complex |CITS: [10809695]|.
/Additionally, CAR2 expression is unduced by the two positive regulators Dal81p and Dal82p as well as allophanate, a degradation product of urea |CITS:[10559172]|. 
/
/Wild type S. cerevisiae cells normally synthesize proline by a pathway involving the gene products of PRO1, PRO2, and PRO3. However, strains that are mutant for pro1 and pro2 are able to bypass the early steps of proline biosynthesis
/and satisfy their requirement for proline via the arginine degradation pathway.  Although the pro mutants can grow both anaerobically and
/aerobically, they cannot grow on optimal nitrogen sources due to the repression of the genes necessart for arginine and ornithine
/degradation to glutamate semialdehyde |CITS:[2824433]|.

COMMENT - Proline is a non-essential amino acid belonging to the glutamate family of amino acids whose biosynthesis depends
/on the carbon skeleton of glutamic acid. Proline is synthesized from glutamate in the cytoplasm. The P5C reductase
/enzymatic reaction in this pathway is identical to the one in arginine degradation |CITS:[ 6997271]|. Since these
/two pathways converge at this step, the requirement for proline in pro1 and pro2 mutant strains can be satisfied by arginine.
/However, these pro-strains cannot grow on rich media because the presence of optimal nitrogen sources causes
/the repression of genes necessary for arginine degradation |CITS:[2824433]|, |CITS:[10640599]|.
/Many of the genes involved in S. cerevisiae amino acid biosynthesis are coregulated by a process known as the general
/amino acid control system. In response to starvation for any single amino acid, the expression of many biosynthetic enzymes is upregulated |CITS:[3045517]|. Mutational studies
/indicate that both PRO1 and PRO2 expression are regulated by general amino acid control, mediated by the transcriptional activator Gcn4p |CITS:[1350780]|. However,
/expression profiling by microarray analysis shows that only PRO2 is activated by Gcn4p |CITS:[11390663]|.
/In contrast, the expression of PRO3 appears to be constitutively expressed and under no form of regulation.

When other sources of nitrogen like ammonia, asparagine or glutamine are unavailabe, S. cerevisiae degrade proline into glutmate via the proline utilization pathway in the mitochondria |CITS:[387737]|, |CITS:[387738]|. This degradation is catalyzed by proline oxidase and delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, which are encoded by the nuclear genes PUT1 and PUT2 respectively |CITS: [3537723]|, |CITS: [ 6358862]|.  Both PUT1 and PUT2 are positively regulated by the transcriptional activator Put3p |CITS:[14517252]|. Although Put3p is bound constitutively to the promoters of PUT1 and PUT2, transcriptional upregulation only occurs in the presense of proline and absence of a preferred nitrogen source |CITS:[10629046]|, |CITS:[1986247]|. PUT1 is also positively regulated by the GATA factors Gln3p and Nil1p/Gat1p |CITS: [7891726]|, |CITS:[12796300]|. The presence of a good nitrogen source, such as ammonia or glutamine, supresses the proline utilization pathway-an effect known as nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) |CITS: [10640599]|. The transcription factors responsible for PUT1 and PUT2 repression by NCR are Ure2p, Dal80p, and Nil2p |CITS:[8416910]|, |CITS:[9171427]|.

COMMENT - The first five steps of arginine biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae take place in the mitochondrion |CITS: [11553611]||CITS: [Hinnebusch]|. This part of the pathway is known as the acetylated derivatives cycle because the acetyl group that is added to L-glutamate in the first step of the pathway is recycled via N-acetylglutamate generated in the fifth step. The enzymes that catalyze the second and third steps are encoded by a single gene (ARG5,6) that is translated into a pre-protein which is imported into mitochondria and cleaved there to yield two enzymes, N-acetylglutamate kinase and N-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase |CITS: [1649049]|. These enzymes form a complex with each other and with N-acetylglutamate synthase, the first enzyme in the pathway, which may have implications for regulation of their activity |CITS: [11553611]|.  The mitochondrial steps of the arginine biosynthesis pathway result in the formation of ornithine, which is exported to the cytoplasm by the transporter Ort1p |CITS: [8798783]|. In the cytoplasm, L-ornithine is converted to L-arginine in three reactions mediated by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, arginosuccinate synthase, and argininosuccinate lyase.  Transcription of genes of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, as well as of other amino acid biosynthetic pathways, is activated by the transcription factor Gcn4p under conditions of amino acid starvation |CITS: [11390663]||CITS: [Hinnebusch]|. Transcription of ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6, and ARG8 is also repressed in the presence of arginine by the ArgR/Mcm1p complex, which consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p, and Mcm1p |CITS: [14563547]|. The transcriptional activator Gcn4p interacts with subunits of the ArgR/Mcm1p repressor, allowing for fine-tuning of transcriptional control in response to arginine availability |CITS: [15289616]|.
/
/General Background (from MetaCyc)
/
/Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways. The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via N-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis, thus keeping the two pathways separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein).
/
/About This Pathway (from MetaCyc)
/
/The cyclic pathway for arginine biosynthesis has been demonstrated in many organisms, including the prokaryotes Bacillaceae, pseudomonads, cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and archaebacteria, as well as eukaryotic organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora sp., and Chlamydomonas sp.
/
/Organisms that employ this pathway possess the argJ gene, which encodes the enzyme ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). OAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from N--acetyl-ornithine to glutamate, generating ornithine and N-acetyl-glutamate (NAG). Since the later is the substrate for another enzyme in this pathway, N-acetyl-glutamate kinase (encoded by argB), which catalyzes a previous step, this reaction effectively converts the otherwise linear pathway to a cyclical pathway |CITS: [8025667 ]|. While most of the NAG in these organisms is generated by OAT, some of it is still generated by N-acetyl-ornithine synthase (NAGS, EC 2.3.1.1, encoded by argA), which fulfils an anaplerotic (replenishment of pathway intermediates) role to replenish NAG that is lost due to degradation or cell division |CITS: [12633501 ]|.
/
/In some bacteria, such as Bacillus sp. |CITS: [8473852 ]|, Nisseria gonorrhoeae |CITS:  [1339419 ]|, Thermotoga neapolitana |CITS: [10931207 ] | and in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) |CITS: [9428669 ]|, OAT can have a dual enzymic function. In these organisms, either N-acetylornithine or acetyl-CoA can be used as acetyl donors for formation of NAG. argJ genes from such organisms can complement both argE and argA mutations in E. coli. However, these organisms still possess separate NAGS enzymes encoded by argA genes. The biological role of duplicate NAGS activity in these organisms remains to be elucidated |CITS: [12633501 ]|.

COMMON-NAME - asparagine degradation
CITATIONS - 10640599
CITATIONS - 17308034
COMMENT - Like many other amino acids, asparagine may be utilized by <i>S. cerevisiae</i> as a sole source of nitrogen. Catabolism of asparagine for nitrogen involves the action of asparaginases, which hydrolyze the amide group in the side chain of asparagine. This converts asparagine to aspartate and releases an assimilable molecule of ammonia. Further nitrogen can be derived from the newly generated aspartate molecule via its reversible conversion to glutamate by aspartate aminotransferases. Glutamate, whose amino group can be hydrolyzed to release ammonia, represents one of the major sources of nitrogen for biosynthetic reactions in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.

COMMENT - Cysteine is a proteinogenic amino acid and sulfur source in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. As a thiol-containing amino acid, cysteine plays an important role in stabilizing protein structure via disulfide bridges and possesses numerous biochemical properties that can facilitate enzyme catalysis. It is also involved in the biosynthesis of glutathione, a tripeptide that acts as a cellular redox buffer.
/
/<i>S. cerevisiae</i> synthesizes cysteine through the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which converts homocysteine to cysteine via the formation of a cystathionine intermediate. This takes place over two steps: In the first, cystathionine -synthase (Cys4p) catalyzes a -displacement reaction where the thiol group of homocysteine displaces the hydroxyl group of serine to produce cystathionine. In the second, cystathionine -lyase (Cys3p) catalyzes an ,-elimination reaction where cystathionine is hydrolyzed to produce cysteine, -ketobutyrate, and ammonia.

COMMENT - While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support growth |CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]|.  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen |CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]|. S. cerevisiae degrade the aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) and the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and iso-leucine) via the Ehrlich pathway |CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]|.  This pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil |CITS:[10989420][Large 86]|.  Fusel alcohols are important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented food products and beverages (as reported in |CITS:[9546164]|.
/
/The primary aminotransferase in tryptophan degradation is postulated to be Aro9p |CITS:[6763508]|.  In vitro studies demonstrated that Aro9p is active with phenylpyruvate, pyruvate, or p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, but not 2-oxoglutarate as the amino acceptor |CITS:[6763508]|.  Aro9p is induced by aromatic amino acids and is subject to nitrogen regulation |CITS:[6763508][10207060]|. The decarboxylase encoding gene ARO10 appears to be transcriptionally regulated in a similar fashion|CITS:[10207060]|.  Gap1p, a general amino acid permease,  and Wap1p, an inducible amino acid permease with wide substrate specificity, appear to be the main uptake systems for utilizing aromatic amino acids |CITS:[10207060]|.

COMMENT - Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches|CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  One branch proceeds to tyrosine and phenylalanine, and the other to tryptophan |CITS:[Jones]|.  The series of reactions to chorismate, called the shikimate pathway, and the series of reactions from chorismate to tryptophan have been found to be common to all eukaryotes and prokaryotes studied thus far (as reported in |CITS:[1943992]|).  In contrast, there appears to be two separate routes for tyrosine and phenylalanine biosynthesis from chorismate, only one of which has been found in S. cerevisiae |CITS:[1943992]|.  S. cerevisiae, similar to E. coli, synthesize tyrosine and phenylalanine via the intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, respectively, whereas some other organisms synthesize them via arogenate |CITS:[1943992]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The carbon flow through the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal end-products. The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two isoenzymes Aro3p or Aro4p, whereby Aro3p is inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p by tyrosine |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan, and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes; however, no GCN4 regulation was found for TYR1 of the tyrosine branch, ARO7 of the tyrosine and phenylalanine branch or TRP1 of the tryptophan branch, |CITS:[1943992]|.

COMMON-NAME - glutamate degradation I
CITATIONS - 11031268
COMMENT - In S. cerevisiae, the main pathway for glutamate degradation is catalyzed by the glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by GDH2 |CITS: [1975578]|. However, glutamate can also by degraded into gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) by the glutamate decarboxylase Gad1p and then converted into succinate by the enzymes encoded by UGA1 and UGA2 |CITS: [11031268]|.
/Glutamate degradation by this pathway and expression of its genes have been shown to be important for oxidative
/stress tolerance. Conditions of oxidative stress elevate the transcript levels of GAD1 and UGA2 |CITS: [11031268]|.
/UGA1 and UGA2 expression is also upregulated in the presence of GABA which is mediated by the transcriptional
/activators Uga3p and Uga35p/Dal81p |CITS: [3888627]|, |CITS:[2653828]|. These transcription factors bind to upstream activation sites in the promoters of GABA-regulated genes known as the UAS-GABA |CITS: [12235130]|, |CITS:[2653838]|. Regulation of Gad1p is suggested to be
/linked to calcium levels as the protein is able to bind calmodulin |CITS:[11031268]|. S. cerevisiae cells in which this pathway
/is blocked are more sensitive to oxidative stress and can no longer grow on GABA as their sole nitrogen source |CITS: [11031268]|, |CITS: [3888627]|].

COMMON-NAME - glutamate degradation IX
CITATIONS - 1975578
COMMENT - In S. cerevisiae cells, the amino group of glutamate and the amide group of glutamine are the source of nitrogen for
/all other macromolecules |CITS: [1975578]|. In order to provide ammonia for the synthesis of glutamine during growth on 
/glutamate-yielding nitrogen sources, cells degrade glutamate into ammonia. The main pathway for S. cerevisiae glutamate degradation
/is catalyzed by the NAD dependent glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by GDH2 |CITS:[1975578]|.
/Transcriptional regulation of GDH2 is dependent upon six different sequence elements present in the promoter |CITS:[1682801]|. 
/Two elements behave as upstream activation sites (UAS) while the remaining four sites inhibit the effects of the two UASs |CITS: [1652057]|. 
/One UAS has been shown to activate transcription during growth on nonfermentable carbon sources or on limiting amounts of glucose |CITS:[1652057]|.
/The other UAS is under the control of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) |CITS: [4394512]|. Under nitrogen-poor conditions, GDH2 expression is upregulated by the transcriptional activator Gln3p and the co-activator Hfi1p |CITS:[1990286]|,
/|CITS:[8416910]|, |CITS:[10048020]|. Conversely, in the presence of an optimal nitrogen source such as glutamine, GDH2 transcription is repressed by the transcription factor
/Ure2p |CITS:[1990286]|. Unrelated to NCR, GDH2 gene expression is regulated by ammonia concentrations.
/An increase in intracellular ammonia leads to a decrease in GDH2 expression |CITS:[12851403]| but an increase in extracellular ammonia leads to an increase in GDH2 transcription and Gdh2p activity
/|CITS:[7592450]|. Gdh2p enzyme activity also appears to be regulated by phosphorylation through cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent protein kinases and subsequent proteolysis |CITS:[6319381]|, |CITS:[7009211]|.

COMMENT - While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support growth |CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]|.  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen |CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]|. S. cerevisiae degrade the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, iso-leucine, and valine) and the aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) via the Ehrlich pathway |CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]|.  This pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil |CITS:[10989420][Large 86]|.  Fusel alcohols are important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented food products and beverages (as reported in |CITS:[9546164]|.
/
/Each of the three steps in branched-chain amino acid degradation can be catalyzed by more than one isozyme; which enzyme is used appears to depend on the amino acid, the carbon source and the stage of growth of the culture |CITS:[12499363]|. In leucine degradation, Thi3p is believed to be the major decarboxylase |CITS: [12499363]|.

TYPES - Fatty-Acid-and-Lipid-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - phospholipids degradation
COMMENT - In addition to being a primary structural components of cell membranes, phospholipids may also be thought of as a reservoir of signaling molecules. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C, for instance, generates the signaling molecules inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). <i>S. cerevisiae</i> catalyzes this reaction via Plc1p, a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C involved in a variety of biological processes including nutrient sensing and filamentous growth. On the other hand, degradation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phospholipase D (Spo14p) yields phosphatidic acid and choline; this activity generates PA required for sporulation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. A phospholipase C specific for PC has yet to be identified in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, however PC may also serve as substrate for phospholipases B (Plb1-3p and Nte1p), which hydrolyze PC to yield glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and two fatty acids. Both phospholipases B and D are thought to mediate PC turnover in yeast, and phospholipase B (as Plb1p) has also been implicated in acyl chain remodeling.

COMMENT - In most organisms, the primary mode of fatty acid catabolism is -oxidation. The -oxidation cycle catalyzes the complete oxidation of a fatty acid molecule, removing two carbon atoms (in the form of acetyl-CoA) with each turn of the cycle. The subcellular location in which -oxidation occurs varies by organism; in bacteria, -oxidation occurs in the cytoplasm, whereas in mammalian cells it occurs in both the mitochondria and the peroxisome. In contrast, -oxidation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, plants, and most other fungi occurs exclusively in the peroxisome.
/
/-oxidation begins with the activation of a fatty acid with coenzyme A, producing an acyl-CoA. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the uptake of free fatty acids as well as their activation with coenzyme A occurs via the acyl-CoA synthases Fat1p and Faa1p-Faa4p. The acyl-CoA molecule is then oxidized, introducing a double bond between C2 (the -carbon) and C3 (the -carbon). This step is catalyzed by acyl-CoA oxidase, encoded by POX1 in yeast. In the third step, the double bond is hydrated, leading to the formation of a hydroxyl group on C3. The stereochemistry of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate is specific to the type of -oxidation pathway. In fungal peroxisomes, -oxidation proceeds via (3R)-hydroxy intermediates; in contrast, mitochondrial -oxidation in mammals proceeds via the (3S) enantiomer. In the fourth step, the hydroxyl group is oxidized to a carbonyl group, forming a 3-ketoacyl-CoA intermediate. Steps 3-4 are both catalyzed by the multifunctional enzyme Fox2p in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Lastly, the 3-ketoacyl-CoA intermediate undergoes thiolytic cleavage between C2 and C3, yielding one acetyl-CoA and an acyl-CoA molecule shortened by two carbon atoms. This step is catalyzed by 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, encoded by POT1 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.

COMMENT - Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is an essential myo-inositol-containing phospholipid in all eukaryotes. It is the third most abundant phospholipid found in the membranes of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and a precursor to phosphoinositides, inositol polyphosphates, and complex sphingolipids. PI and its metabolites are involved in a variety of biological processes including signal transduction, nuclear mRNA export, vesicle trafficking, and synthesis of the lipid anchor glycosylphosphatidylinositol. 
/
/PI is synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum from cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) and inositol in a reaction catalyzed by PI synthase (Pis1p). 
/Synthesis of PI is increased by exogenously supplied inositol or zinc depletion. When cells are grown in inositol, PI synthase activity is greatly stimulated while phosphatidylserine synthase (Cho1p), which competes with Pis1p for their common substrate, CDP-DAG, is inhibited. Under conditions of zinc depletion, the transcription factor Zap1p binds to a zinc-responsive cis-acting element (UAS-ZRE) in the PIS1 promoter and increases PI synthase expression. Increased PI synthesis through zinc depletion or inositol supplementation leads to reduced CDP-DAG levels as well as its precursor, phosphatidic acid (PA). This PA level drop causes the Opi1p repressor to translocate to the nucleus, where it subsequently represses the transcription of many UAS-INO-containing phospholipid biosynthetic genes. Thus, in addition to its role in the biosynthesis of many important metabolites, PI synthesis indirectly contributes to the transcriptional regulation of phospholipid metabolism through its effect on intracellular PA level.

COMMENT - The phosphorylated products of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns, PI), collectively referred to as phosphoinositides or phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs, PIPs), are membrane-bound lipids that function as structural components of membranes, as well as regulators of many cellular processes in eukaryotes, including vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking, cell wall integrity, and actin cytoskeleton organization (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]| and |CITS:[8599109]|). PtdInsPs are also precursors of the water-soluble inositol phosphates (IPs), an important class of intracellular signaling molecules (reviewed in |CITS:[16781889], [16429326], [17488633]|).
/
/The inositol ring of the membrane phospholipids and the water-soluble IPs are readily phosphorylated and dephosphorylated at a number of positions making them well suited as key regulators. PtdIns can be phosphorylated at one or a combination of positions (3', 4', or 5') on the inositol headgroup, generating a set of unique stereoisomers that have specific biological functions (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). These stereoisomers have been shown to be restricted to certain membranes (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) is the major PtdInsP species of the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in the vesicular trafficking of secretory proteins from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P2) is the major species found at the plasma membrane and is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization, as well as cell wall integrity, and heat shock response pathways (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) is found predominantly at endosomal membranes and in multivesicular bodies (MVB), where it plays a role in endosomal and vacuolar membrane trafficking. Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[3,5]P2) is found on vacuolar membranes where it plays an important role in the MVB sorting pathway (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|).
/
/Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the inositol headgroups of PtdInsPs at specific membrane locations signals the recruitment of certain proteins essential for vesicular transport (|CITS:[8599109]|, and reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). PtdInsPs recruit proteins that contain PtdInsP-specific binding domains, such as the well-studied pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that recognizes the phosphorylation pattern of specific PtdInsP inositol headgroups (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|).
/
/A number of kinases and phosphatases are involved in the generation and interconversions of PtdInsPs, 
/the majority of which have been well conserved during evolution (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). The 
/PtdInsP kinases, in contrast to the lipid phosphatases, have a higher degree of specificity. While each 
/kinase appears to phosphorylate only one substrate, many of the lipid phosphatases can dephosphorylate 
/a number of substrates.

COMMENT - Inositol phosphates (IPs) are an important class of signaling molecules that regulate cellular processes such as transcription, mRNA export, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, glucose-induced calcium signaling, telomere elongation, vacuolar biogenesis, the stress response, cell wall synthesis and phosphate homeostasis (reviewed in |CITS:[16781889]| and |CITS:[16429326]|).
/
/The water-soluble IPs are derived from the lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
/(PIP2, PI(4,5)P2, PtdIns 4,5-P2). Plc1p hydrolyses PIP2 to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and
/ diacylglycerol, releasing IP3 from the membrane |CITS:[8395015]|.  IP3 is then sequentially
/ phosphorylated to inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4) and inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) by
/ the inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) Arg82p |CITS:[10720331][11311242][10683435]| and
/ reviewed in |CITS:[16781889]|. IP5 is further phosphorylated to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6, phytate)
/ by Ipk1p or to the inositol pyrophosphate diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (PP-IP4) by 
/Arg82p or Kcs1p |CITS:[10960485][10827188][11311242]| and reviewed in |CITS:[16781889]|. 
/The fully phosphorylated ring of IP6 is further phosphorylated to the inositol pyrophosphates 
/diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-IP5, IP7) and bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate
/ (2[PP]-IP4, [PP]2-IP4, IP8) |CITS:[17412958][11956213][10574768]| reviewed in |CITS:[16781889]|
/ and |CITS:[16429326]|.  Two different forms of PP-IP5 have been identified, 5-PP-IP7 synthesized
/ by Kcs1p and 4- or 6-PP-IP7 synthesized by Vip1p (the exact phosphorylation position has yet to
/ be determined) |CITS:[17412958]|.  Kcs1p and Vip1p are believed to work in concert to form
/ [PP]2-IP4; the PP-IP5 product produced by one enzyme is converted to [PP]2-IP4 by the other
/ enzyme |CITS:[17412958]|. [PP]2-IP4 was shown to be dephosphorylated to PP-IP5 and PP-IP5
/ to IP6 by the phosphatase Ddp1p, but the particular isomer(s) are not yet known |CITS:[10419486]|.

CITATIONS - PALTAUF
COMMENT - The mevalonate (MVA) pathway synthesizes the two common precursors to all isoprenoids: isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The MVA pathway exists largely in eukaryotes and archaebacteria and is one of two pathways for IPP and DMAPP biosynthesis found in nature. The other pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, exists mainly in eubacteria and higher plants. Yeasts and other fungi employ the MVA pathway for isoprenoid production.
/
/In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the MVA pathway begins with the condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (Erg10p). This reaction forms acetoacetyl-CoA, which reacts with a third molecule of acetyl-CoA via 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase (Erg13p) to form HMG-CoA. In turn, HMG-CoA is converted to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase in two NADPH-dependent reduction steps. This reaction is catalyzed by two isozymes in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: Hmg1p and Hmg2p. Depending on culture conditions, Hmg1p accounts for around 83% of HMG-CoA reductase activity in wild type cells. After sequential phosphorylation of MVA to MVA-5-diphosphate via MVA kinase (Erg12p) and phospho-MVA kinase (Erg8), MVA-5-diphosphate is decarboxylated in an ATP-dependent manner by MVA pyrophosphate decarboxylase (Mvd1p) to yield IPP. IPP can then go to be isomerized to DMAPP via isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (Idi1p).
/
/The addition of IPP units to DMAPP produces short-chain prenyl diphosphates that serve as precursors to many essential metabolites. For example, DMAPP can be sequentially condensed with two molecules of IPP to form farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). FPP can undergo a long series of conversion steps in the sterol biosynthesis pathway to produce ergosterol, an important contributor to membrane integrity and the major sterol in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. In addition to sterols, FPP is a precursor to many other primary metabolites including dolichols, ubiquinones, carotenoids, and polyprenols for protein prenylation.

COMMENT - The polyol glycerol has several biological roles in yeast. In carbon metabolism, glycerol is a major byproduct of ethanol fermentation and can be used as a sole source of carbon under aerobic conditions. In osmoregulation, glycerol acts as a key osmolyte during hyperosmotic stress and is the primary compatible solute in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Biosynthesis of glycerol, as a NADH-consuming process, also plays an important role in maintaining cytosolic redox balance during anaerobic conditions by oxidizing excess NADH to NAD. Consistent with these functions, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cells defective in glycerol biosynthesis are sensitive to osmotic stress and do not exhibit anaerobic growth.
/
/Glycerol is produced from the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate via glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, consuming NADH and forming glycerol-3-phosphate. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is encoded by both GPD1 and GPD2. GPD1 is induced by osmotic stress and is thought to play a role in osmoregulation, while GPD2 is induced under anaerobic conditions and may be involved in redox balancing. Glycerol-3-phosphate is subsequently dephosphorylated by glycerol-3-phosphatase, producing glycerol. There are two genes encoding for glycerol-3-phosphatase in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>: GPP1, which is constitutively expressed, and GPP2, which is induced during hyperosmotic stress.

COMMENT - The ergosterol biosynthesis pathway is required for generation of a major constituent of the fungal plasma membrane, ergosterol |CITS: [Paltauf]||CITS: [8561481]|. This pathway is fungal-specific; plasma membranes of other organisms are composed predominantly of other types of sterol. However, the pathway is not universally present in fungi; for example, Pneumocystis carinii plasma membranes lack ergosterol |CITS: [12531182]|. In S. cerevisiae, some steps in the pathway are dispensible while others are essential for viability |CITS: [8277826]|.  
/
/The ergosterol biosynthesis pathway has been the subject of intensive investigation as a target of antifungal drugs |CITS: [11815273]|. The major target of azole antifungal drugs is lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, a member of the cytochrome P450 family known as Erg11 protein in many fungal species. Squalene epoxidase (Erg1p in S. cerevisiae) is the specific target of allylamine drugs such as terbinafine |CITS: [14638499]|. Mutations in the genes encoding these enzymes and others in the pathway, as well as alterations in the expression levels of the pathway constituents, can lead to antifungal drug resistance |CITS: [11815273]|.

TYPES - Fatty-acid-biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - myristate biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 6 5153:EV-EXP-IDA:3503345907:cindy
COMMENT - Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts |CITS: [Lynen69]|. To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) |CITS: [1350093]|).  Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) |CITS: [7649444]|). 
/
/There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6  |CITS: [17448991]|. Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) |CITS: [365179], [1100391], [10785388], [3528750], [374077]|.
/
/FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 |CITS: [7925441]| and theinositol/choline-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p |CITS: [1461729][7862526]|. The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 |CITS: [11713312]|. The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded |CITS: [1735446][8262967]|.

COMMENT - Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts |CITS: [Lynen69]|. To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) |CITS: [1350093]|).  Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) |CITS: [7649444]|).
/
/There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6  |CITS: [17448991]|. Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) |CITS: [365179], [1100391], [10785388], [3528750], [374077]|.
/
/FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 |CITS: [7925441]| and theinositol/choline-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p |CITS: [1461729][7862526]|. The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 |CITS: [11713312]|. The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded |CITS: [1735446][8262967]|.
